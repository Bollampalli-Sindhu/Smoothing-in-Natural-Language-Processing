the commission is currently carefully reviewing the united states ' arguments .	1.0473450161247617
i really think that people should be extremely cautious .	1.083698793353775
as far as excessive paper is concerned , the dilemma is spelt out by mrs morgan .	1.0019050467005384
scrapie	1.0835709380285035
it is also an economic disaster for all the people who make their living from the sea and from tourism , fishermen , oyster farmers , shellfish farmers , people who make a living from the salt marshes , shopkeepers , etc .	1.1362193368013014
i am thinking , for example , of the idea that these guidelines are not specific enough in their recommendations .	1.0577680436242405
this kind of tourism , which is undertaken mainly by large numbers of senior citizens , is just as important .	1.0114199837166193
i thank the president , mrs fontaine , who just yesterday expressed her opinion by refuting the implication of this house .	1.2765085216268854
moreover , i would also urge this house to take into consideration the opinion of the committee on employment and social affairs , adding a whole raft of thoughts on key areas such as combating social exclusion , support for the social economy and the implementation of the employment strategy .	1.3776305843732428
prime ministers , members of parliament , ministers , in the professional arena , doctors , lawyers , pilots , generals .	1.0871210994306297
as we look at the europe of networking which you describe , it is very important that europe concentrates on its core business , that we have the courage to suggest areas where europe may perhaps stand back .	1.1444916568460577
when we discuss the tse regulation , commissioner , we must also clarify that we shortly intend to discuss separate proposals under article 152 as the corresponding legal base for products excluded from this regulation , such as cosmetics , medicinal products or animal feed .	1.0872668488970187
mr president , the katiforis report has been amended according to the proposals , notably , of the europe for a union of nations group , which were adopted in the committee on fisheries and , in my opinion , this version is an improvement on the original .	1.2931970102875063
the challenge of enlargement is political .	1.0116247264096299
i remember what portugal and greece used to be like when i drove through those countries for the first time twenty - five years ago .	1.0872325197870905
we could , if one third of the members of parliament so requested , require that the council and the commission look into the matter .	1.0170328814577305
i am most grateful to the commissioner for his plain talking today and i would ask the commission to force the pace now .	1.0220638035798444
the vote will take place on thursday at 12 . 00 p . m .	1.720417111977996
because what is it that unites us in europe ? surely it is the values and principles of freedom , democracy and respect for human rights , more than anything .	1.0872325198317119
a third decision will be considered in the light of the mission of commissioner nielson .	1.0871265951603861
in the second , life - environment strand , which is more concerned with projects involving small and medium - sized enterprises and local government agencies , the incorporation of the environment in other policies is expressed very clearly indeed .	1.1102494353329133
just you go home and say : " we have not concerned ourselves with standards to date " .	1.0872325188459944
that is why in november 1998 the commission presented a proposal for a directive on worker information and consultation which has since then received your strong support .	1.0400319645488387
the current directive on ucits has become antiquated and outdated .	1.0632593524306464
tourism and employment	1.0153718768331954
so , in the first part on the new forms of european governance , the words ' federalism ' and ' superstate ' are not mentioned at all .	1.358631730324546
we urge you to take the opportunity to establish the real staffing needs of the commission based on the essential activities for which it is responsible .	1.083834373350936
do not misunderstand me : i too believe that we need to take effective action against the milosevic regime .	1.0872325698000467
their expertise , is , of course , superior to that of the commission .	1.0921017860614113
the procedures for setting additional control measures that already exist in community legislation will be used to establish withdrawal schemes based on the state of health of the fish in order to minimise a possible environmental impact .	1.0064713216957077
it is true in regard to guaranteeing the free movement of labour without loss of social entitlements . it applies to the fact of our having to coordinate our economies ; and it applies in the case of economic cooperation .	1.01565867199682
on behalf of my group , but also personally , i hope that the vital financial spirit of the union will pave the way for the creation of a european legal system which respects citizens ' rights and guarantees , which is to say a legal system that will raise guarantees to the acceptable levels hitherto unseen in many states .	1.5248572901760158
i should like to stress quite particularly here that we have already made considerable progress under current national and european water protection laws , however imperfect they are and however little they are complied with in the member states .	1.228371507150171
the actual appropriations available for leader + compared with leader 2 are smaller despite their increase by 15% ( from eur 1 775 million for leader 2 to eur 2 020 million for leader +).	1.8693525773938295
i know that we do a great deal of good , but let us start with this very essential aspect .	1.0222127696189922
i should like to highlight certain measures which we are trying to introduce in another european region affected by immigration - the canary islands .	1.1003362418199107
one of the goals of those programmes is to increase the number of women in managerial positions .	1.0144298182524276
the rapporteur has already hinted at this in no uncertain terms , namely , the issue of interethnic relations .	1.1112073907524638
a lack of progress in the final status negotiations should not jeopardise implementation of the three above - mentioned interim agreements .	1.0093428069557042
this has led to an increase in the number of women involved in political decision making which , in turn , has provided opportunities for further research .	1.430477982546907
not to use women ' s talents in decision making is an unacceptable waste .	1.0094874926138584
on the contrary , we should concentrate on working out persuasive proposals on the necessary reforms , in collaboration with the commission whose own proposals are worthy of note .	1.451412723035798
the new agreement will entail a firm commitment on both sides to good governance as a fundamental and positive element of the partnership , a subject for regular dialogue in an area which enjoys active community support .	1.040627288510361
this is a europe of regions in which the regions , which are weaker than the nation states , will easily submit to brussels .	1.0122845131220766
this would be a minimum requirement , i believe , on the dawn of the third millennium .	1.2573238388011336
in an industry worth some eur 600 billion annually , even a slight dip in confidence levels can have significant effects .	1.0872325198317045
profitability at all costs means going against fraternity and against social cohesion .	1.0844253460972713
we also notice that , according to the explanatory statement , modernisation does not mean harmonisation of social security arrangements , either , and that harmonisation might be downright damaging as it might place greater demands on weaker member states at the same time that competitive considerations might exert pressure on others to cut back .	1.0873645818349673
what we need are visible rights for each and every citizen ; the charter of fundamental rights must be made legally binding for all the citizens of the union .	1.1841951427494275
new types of funds have been introduced in the various member states which are not permitted to market their units in other member states .	1.0107478305981012
this means that in terms of quantity management too , we need to put in considerable effort to ensure that life upstream and downstream is not affected by it .	1.0570823295425238
and , of course , these policies need a budget , they need to be given financial teeth .	1.1550142738291318
in my view the next five years will decide the future of thousands of marginal family farms .	1.0443385339088829
we ally ourselves with demonstrations and international campaigns .	1.0872325197827875
this sector of activity is also a deciding factor in the economic and social development of less favoured regions , especially the most remote and island regions , which have undisputed assets in this area .	1.0872324434851146
there are hundreds of thousands of refugees in thailand and india from burma and yet it seems that that country is no longer given any attention .	1.932694621894033
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this report is very important not only in terms of its content but also because it represents an initial step towards the establishment of better relations in judicial cooperation .	2.3541956297208797
the commission has the cynicism to consider wage restraint as a positive factor , whereas in france alone , over three million workers receive a salary that is close to the poverty line and they barely survive any better than the other three million people kept unemployed by an insane economy .	1.1440657679260506
we need to be able to prosecute people who commit fraud against the european union .	1.3535836029712343
it was because of our concern about these issues that we disagreed with some of the proposals put forward by the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy , and in particular those relating to an excessively restrictive timetable and to the scant attention paid to social and agricultural aspects , which are very important for a country like portugal , which suffers from water shortage problems and also inadequate socio - economic development .	1.438119771192865
i must add , however , that cooperation between our action groups and similar groups in third countries went too far for the member states .	1.0944779605981343
that would seem odd to me .	1.0872324380380352
will we enlarge with or without deep reform ?	1.0872300600705513
we cannot be accused of bad management .	1.0113666498753942
i do not know if you are aware , representatives of the council of ministers , of your responsibility over these last few years , and in 2000 as well , for the plight of the families who live on anchovy fishing in the north of the iberian peninsular .	1.3217685917775341
it is the tisza , hungary ' s second river , perhaps its most beautiful and most loved by its people , that has borne the brunt .	1.0029055723020113
a question has been put by mrs villiers who referred to enhancing portfolio management .	1.0840591953913858
this is the citizen of a state ' s prerogative , for it is the founding principle of a democracy .	1.0026957597021038
as i have also said before to this house , the commission is favourable to inserting the charter in the eu treaty .	1.0061924550065897
the issue of the financial envelope was staunchly defended by parliament in the face of the council ' s very meagre opening offer .	1.3599622655724593
we must preserve this law and peace in the european union if we are to be able to go forth as peacemakers in the world .	1.0658298060103883
it is , therefore , with good reason that we bring this up here today .	1.4248307738295183
anyone who lets men happily climb the career ladder and worries only about childcare places without fighting against the way in which the work of reproduction is shared out unevenly has not - and unfortunately that includes women - understood the concept of mainstreaming !	1.0872325198317052
one of them is the series of measures which must be adopted immediately in order to deal with the specific effects of social exclusion . the second is to create internationally competitive conditions , which will enable us to improve the economic fabric of the european union , and this will have positive knock - on effects on the problems of social exclusion .	1.2718701318991275
furthermore , it should be noted that these provisions were adopted within the council by a procedure without debate and without consulting parliament .	1.2141598612644342
we are aware of the fact that the price of water and water services is a complicated issue and that account must be taken not only of environmental goals but also of social and economic goals .	1.8669346869030845
only in europe are human rights enforceable in law .	1.084239288835749
. i would like to begin by congratulating the honourable member on the way in which he introduced this extremely important debate .	2.1427107396106106
in honour of the tremendous work he carried out over a difficult period the joint bureau in nassau made him an honorary president , and we wish him well in his retirement .	1.088214209332681
finally , and i think this is important : why not have the honesty today to relay what was disclosed in a recent un study explaining that , if spain wishes to preserve its work , retirement and pension potential , it is no good just giving 30 000 immigrants a year legal status ; it needs to be prepared to accept 12 million immigrants between now and the year 2050 ?	1.0139506613566882
there is a chemical factory in the north - west which wrote to me to say that we must vote against this legislation .	1.0047128836010433
this programme will hopefully encourage member states to act with greater determination to increase the use of renewable energy .	1.0872333563324295
in order to make these reforms , however , and in order to make progress with the 2001 legislative programme , we must be very sure , not only of the strengths of the reformer himself , but also of the opinions of others .	1.0952639680881466
we know from media reports that bombs and weapons were dumped just off the coast .	1.0124962106613513
may i , to finish off , thank mrs berger for the great care she has taken in studying the different amendments and for having , in that way , added an important degree of meaning to her report ?	1.087231422746305
my fear - even if you shake your head , mr prodi - is that this will translate into what some countries have thought for years , that the commission should be a simple secretariat for the council of ministers .	1.0872294738901491
however , one aspect of any action with regard to criminal procedures must not be forgotten - the right of defence .	1.008377378632526
this is a belgian government measure which flies in the face of the schengen treaty .	1.0047936005713087
our group categorically condemns this perception and , in this sense , does not intend to support this resolution .	1.0872325199885697
commissioner barnier , i know - at least i think i know - that you and the representatives of the portuguese presidency share these values : make the most of the chances you were given by the december conference to include these subjects and principles , because this is the only way we will build a lasting europe .	1.0290730401804544
the austrian extreme right has been gifted an unwarranted present .	1.4295208933938395
so , we will try to be very clear about how and when to use it .	1.0231229539956934
we believe in europe , while it seems that others have started the process of breaking up the union .	1.0146998462828376
in this sense , all high seismic risk areas must be excluded a priori for nuclear installations such as this .	1.1934370003364363
although it is currently impossible to calculate how many people have died , we do know that around 80 000 are in imminent danger of drowning and 300 000 have lost their homes and crops .	1.002802428967604
the officials responsible for financial control should be deployed on a decentralised basis , that is , in the operational directorates - general , amongst those of their colleagues that spend the money , so that they are immediately available when problems arise and so as to render the checks less ponderous and time - consuming .	1.0872302034205898
however , we must also ask ourselves about our own democratic arrangements .	1.4541454743394653
i am of the opinion that these are two important remarks , and that is why i am reiterating them here .	2.6536074568821704
your behaviour stems from your own prejudices , you are dispensing with any form of political debate and you are displaying precisely the kind of behaviour you claim to oppose .	1.0872325198306105
the council therefore expressed its satisfaction , in its december conclusions , at the substantial contributions announced by the european commission , which will indirectly assist in returning the situation to normal , together with similar contributions made by member states .	1.021468244665337
i became convinced of this in sarajevo when i had to negotiate the periodic exchanges of prisoners which accompanied each successive ceasefire agreement , none of which unfortunately lasted , between the parties to the conflict .	1.0872294567446716
therefore the house was probably quite willing to go ahead at that stage .	1.087232519831098
the prime minister of the united kingdom and his foreign secretary yesterday made statements on their policy in regard to the voting system within the council .	1.1213672114861906
i have had a little to do with this too .	1.0472149362573526
the assessment of whether or not the discharge will be granted also depends to some extent on where the emphasis is placed .	1.0076616222130832
in conclusion , while welcoming commission approval for leader+, i am concerned about the time delay between the ending of leader ii and the commencement of the new programme .	1.206965930996207
mr rübig has the floor .	1.0871245885383563
the commission will have to be very vigorous in the responses that it puts out to some of the comments that it will be receiving as part of the campaign .	1.2082756366507128
the treaties provide for the european union to help developing countries to develop but , as the previous speakers have explained so well , there are various distortions to these declarations .	1.0871416203810444
that is why i urge you to vote against amendments nos 38 and 45 .	1.3973590880898834
madame president , the people of austria have spoken by electing herr haider to their parliament .	1.1299436478320861
but all exhibitions are in fact looked at first by the so - called comart committee .	1.0710424937079763
i think this policy has been reasonably successful in finland , as testified by the present public system .	1.0123660677824158
this idea will be the focus of much scrutiny and debate .	1.087124424085768
but then again , the central theme of the liberalisation of the postal services is employment .	1.0871237379907825
mr president , i am grateful for the council ' s oral , and also written , reply .	1.5532863818858396
is there a member who wishes to speak on behalf of this group to propose this ?	7.842595552683393
i do believe that reform with all it implies , including the new mechanisms , will very strongly facilitate changes of that kind .	1.2216064323613973
it is therefore quite legitimate and even imperative that we ask ourselves , what purpose do the current common standards and rules serve ?	1.0102136688125958
the president - in - office informed our committee that the current portuguese presidency intended the cfp to be regarded as a policy for ensuring the sustainability of our resources . this must be our objective in europe and throughout the world .	1.163088676744925
what is required here is a training policy to qualify and prepare people for new jobs , for those who already have a job and for those who need a second opportunity , because sometimes , as the title of the film states , the postman always rings twice .	1.0168030370426029
your parliament may consider measures appropriate to counter that situation and then , madame president and only then , may your parliament consider interfering in the constitutional affairs of a country of the european union .	1.0872325198317052
if this happens , the united states ' government and the british government have given it to be understood that they will resort to military intervention .	1.090607349592065
mr president , a journalist is on a fact - finding mission and this calls for freedom .	1.0303647051423424
it has assassinated the spokesman of the popular party in the town council of san sebastián , gregorio ordóñez .	1.0872658037898175
this is because the helsinki agenda is limited to consideration only of the three issues that relate in a fragmentary way to the structure and operation of just two of the european union ' s institutional bodies .	1.1604972997674734
report by olle schmidt ( a5 - 0025/2000 )	1.0872324542356195
i think this is a good agreement .	1.8595090520806883
this may , of course , be seen as an issue concerning the internal market , but also as a public health matter for the whole eu .	1.1457084908173434
for over a year the old commission could have done some work on this .	1.0872324452081858
madam president , i am totally appalled by the commission ' s , i . e . mr bolkestein ' s , political ignorance !	1.5931214477357787
mr president , i also rise on a point of order .	1.4165851617059333
with regard to the second contribution , what we propose is that the exact amount and the date for the implementation of the second stage should be decided in accordance with the external financial needs of kosovo and the contributions of other bilateral donors .	1.43379240142129
water is our most important resource and we must use our vote to ensure that the incentives and pressure are there to really comply with the ospar convention .	1.690032429936736
since we will be very pressed for time in the topical and urgent debate , in view of the many matters to be addressed in an hour and a half , i simply wanted to ask whether the sessional services might not check to see whether we could have an extra half an hour for the topical and urgent debate so that there is sufficient speaking time .	1.0839355294751494
eurosceptics claim that this is a threat to sovereignty , the end of the nation - state , and so on . but the case of the suspect wanted for questioning in connection with the murders of three women in france , including british student , isabel peake , who was thrown off a train , shows why we need mutual recognition .	1.1241013207030297
the importance of smooth - running , comprehensible work cannot possibly be emphasised enough .	1.0040443471866496
we strongly agree on the need to decentralise our assistance programmes to the maximum possible extent .	1.0563886049112812
competition restrictions are to be automatically exempted against the background of this planned system of legal exemption , insofar as the provisions of article 81 ( 3 ) of the treaty on european union allow .	1.0871237344260147
we would ask the council and the commission for clear and prompt action and a political initiative which does not overlook the issue of human rights .	1.5123121446719887
according to the action plan to combat organised crime adopted by the council in april 1997 , the work on the draft mla convention should have been finalised before the end of 1997 .	1.0073319160977783
the measures eligible for funding listed in annex ii of strand a do also seem encouraging in this respect .	1.0871497876136325
apart from that , the tampere european council has already indicated in which direction we , in the commission , should go .	1.5085526190778158
the second concern which i notice that many of you share - it was first expressed by mr bourlanges , but others have repeated it - refers to the situation regarding the other donors .	1.0872324480191948
a moment ago , mr vatanen spoke to us of lower temperatures , not of 20 degrees below zero , but of 40 degrees below zero .	1.4434579036108897
following all of the research , the meeting agreed to a selective closure rather than a general prohibition of fishing for tuna in the mediterranean with purse seine during the period 1 august to 31 august .	1.0836351505422004
i can only say again that commissioner bolkestein will be able to address all the concerns on monday , in the appropriate committee , more competently and in much more detail .	1.3219062388519225
last week echo decided to allocate eur 1 million for flood relief , of which 600 000 will be dispersed through the spanish red cross and 150 000 through msf luxembourg , for operations in mozambique and eur 250 000 to botswana through the german red cross .	1.0872325198254802
one could do so once or twice , but i feel that the un donors should contribute to this as well , for there is a very large hole , as yet unfilled , that we are unable to fill .	1.0872325198323927
this is my first point regarding the policy .	1.3424277740835417
mr president , firstly i must thank mrs belém roseira for taking part in this debate and for her interesting speech on the subject .	1.0378475303561943
the new initiative will continue to pursue these goals by reinforcing them , while particularly promoting equal opportunities between men and women and integrating socially marginalised and disadvantaged groups .	1.0872294365194028
recognition should also be given to the pressures which the delicate marine aqua system faces from urbanisation of coastal areas .	1.0875594187873758
it seemed to us that the agenda lacked content , because our group was thinking in terms of the treaty and , specifically , the protocol on the union ' s institutions .	1.0889982967286755
report ( a5 - 0009/2000 ) by mr graça moura , on behalf of the european parliament delegation to the conciliation committee , on the joint text approved by the conciliation committee for a european parliament and council decision establishing a single financing and programming instrument for cultural cooperation (' culture 2000 ') ( c5 - 0327/1999 - 1998/0169 ( cod )	1.041264983885411
there is a large grey area and a great lack of clarity where criminal sanctions are concerned , and it is precisely in this area that the announcements made by the commission are rather vague .	1.0153350361116509
we must all ensure that it is not always the same person , i . e . the vehicle owner , who pays .	1.0159676779680682
for the best way to reduce world poverty is to help developing countries help themselves .	1.116286642528603
most of us here would not wish to boast about eur 3 million .	1.0839233163705762
mr president , commissioner , andalusia is one of the most tolerant and multiracial regions of the european union .	1.7774827227979781
we had to freeze our resolution on the death penalty or risk the passing of a resolution that would have incorporated wholly unacceptable arguments that asserted that human rights are not universally applicable and valid .	1.0051892062864776
i believe it is only a coincidence , but the commissioner for the environment is also , of course , to participate in this group .	1.4473853568464836
as a result of the economic and political success in our part of the world , of which the eu is just one proof , and in view of the ever greater proliferation of our western values , competition on the world market has grown considerably within the last few decades .	1.8050311943819615
the party to which the mayor of el ejido belongs should , according to the commitments signed in this charter , act forcefully .	1.0871193474928957
the increased participation of our citizens is something i hope and pray for . i would like this participation to be as extensive and productive as possible and i undertake to work to ensure that in the course of the five years covered by the programme it becomes a tangible reality .	1.439827874577637
i also expect the commission to be pro - active in supporting us in our call for codecision in legislative procedures .	1.090366383843699
we deplore , therefore , what is happening in austria .	1.0871269458729267
if you want to combat xenophobia and racism , and i believe that we should , we need to look at the root causes .	1.382759616825304
in line with the usual procedure , it is the european committee for standardisation ( cen ) which puts forward standards in this area , and they are then integrated in to the european agreement concerning the international carriage of dangerous goods by road signed in geneva in 1957 ( known generally as adr ), applicable throughout europe , whose terms and conditions form the basis for the legislation applicable within the eu .	1.3755034958655954
thank you very much , commissioner patten .	2.1426119726165065
let me turn to the assistance provided so far .	1.5069473944730385
what we need here is an integral approach .	1.0737906111634778
sadly , in this case , he has not taken into account those who are affected and seems not to have considered those carrying out the restructuring .	1.1315572391063422
the first is that we need a mature dialogue between the council and the european parliament .	1.3756496427674958
the commission is paying particular attention to legal certainty for smes .	1.0039137591237188
the commission will be called upon , in a report that has yet to be compiled for the year 1999 , to give a detailed explanation of its active role in the elaboration of restructuring plans and approved exemptions , thus enabling a proper assessment of the overall situation to be made .	1.345534173915952
a great deal of suffering could have been avoided if the eu , among others , has acted earlier and more decisively .	1.3678153640924788
what sort of impression will an interested public , as well as the rest of the world , have of this five - year programme ?	1.008462470005789
i consider this to be unacceptable .	1.9005365672049
would sanctions not be appropriate , as the commissioner stated , for the classification society ?	1.0872308252288834
the commission will contact the relevant national authorities to check this .	1.0037861063587206
there is a case as the commissioner mentioned for the implementation of a rapid response facility and rapid response force in situations like this to deal with crises such as we have there because we simply did not have the strategies or the logistical preparations in place .	1.0056104187546722
i will not expand further . we will have the opportunity to do so on other occasions .	1.0053689049961754
i finally come to three interventions about a subject i am supposed to know better than postal services , that is competition .	1.0872325198317052
it is a fact that we are dealing with contradictory policy . time and time again , good intentions are formulated but nothing is implemented .	1.2281394708678344
therefore , if the regulation is adopted , the estimate which is due to appear in march 2000 , the first estimate of the deficit for the 1999 accounting year , will be made using the new system .	1.0780169308825376
the " erika " incident was serious especially for the people of brittany most closely affected , but it was devastating for the wildlife of much of europe .	1.087232519830671
amendment no 4 is of a similar nature .	1.066576626152812
i must also tell you that in the year 2000 , when there is so much talk about us , the coalition talks with the spö failed - and unfortunately so - because the socialist party brought down the negotiated austerity and consolidation programme .	1.0116295507508692
the current globalisation process is - and i quote - ' exclusive rather than inclusive and has widened the inequalities ' . the european union ' s objective must therefore be to help define new ground rules within the union and in international relations .	1.0872332967277614
yet the trade in used car parts is important , especially for those who collect and renovate older vehicles .	1.0837296363560351
in the light of this sympathy , i would like to continue my response as follows .	1.0769004021385085
as regards the subject of flexibility , we propose development partnerships and cooperation both at the geographical level where different kinds of groups would cooperate in a specific geographical area to combat discrimination in the workplace , and at the thematic level where , for example , cooperation could take place in a specific economic sector .	1.0089339369782022
mr president , i would very briefly like to give an explanation of vote , on behalf of the ppe group on the equal report .	1.697192418571478
mr president , mr fischler , my report concerns the vital integration of environmental and fisheries issues , as discussed at the ministerial meeting in bergen .	1.097454376549038
i would nevertheless like to thank the rapporteur and congratulate him on his work . he listened very closely to our arguments at the committee stage , and particularly those on the issue of respecting the rights of the defence , both at national level and at the level of cooperation on criminal law as part of european mutual assistance .	1.9380967328141483
against that background , our group is able to vote in favour of most of the amendments tabled by mrs lienemann , the rapporteur , as adopted in committee .	1.0872618646474732
i will give you an example .	1.5266929227828214
i have in mind budgetary and financing aspects , indebtedness , assistance in sensitive areas such as food safety , humanitarian , educational and health - related issues , and also fields such as the environment , investment and access to information and new technologies . this also applies to the sphere of trade , where we need to ensure real coherence between development policies and other community policies , and also between both types of policy and corresponding policies originating in the member states .	1.4413539597892562
the problem is that the cost is not shared equally between the consumer and the producer : the producer has been forced to bear all the cost .	1.5633499224400575
( applause )	1.0168797810849388
i welcome in particular the proposed new and strict authorisation procedures for additives in animal feeds .	1.1172735425955345
we trusted this commission , from the outset , to begin work on all issues relating to greater equality for men and women .	1.0872325908739442
there is to date no conclusive outcome to this legal challenge .	1.0024302564650283
although the actual implementation of the stability pact has not yet started , the commission has already developed the new instrument , entitled the stabilisation and association agreement .	1.0872294608798858
i should like this programme to become a practical reality and for culture to be not only a factor of enrichment for our citizens , both in personal as well as in social and economic terms , but a right which it is our job to assert , and also the hallmark of rediscovered interaction within the union .	1.0041779503255317
( it ) while article 158 of the ec treaty aims to promote the harmonious development of all of the communities , we must say that the goal of eliminating disparities is still a long way from being fulfilled , or rather in some cases , as with italy ' s objective 1 zones , paradoxically , disparities are being exacerbated , particularly because of the continuing weak approach of the structural apparatus to community procedures and the persistent muddle of procedures ; despite the changes to the rules , the community structures have not yet been streamlined .	1.0088750337655146
i have also been arrested for protesting at faslane .	1.0224278004603313
this aid is considerably less than the previous period , 1993 - 1995 ( a 13% drop in the total amount and a drop from 3 . 8% to 2 . 6% in the amount of aid to the manufacturing sector ).	1.0872324421772852
as this issue will be returning to this house at some stage , i must highlight the working method used between the commission and this parliament .	1.1415608267140198
many speakers have cited examples of the extent to which the various policies are not coherent .	1.0056861702139284
my reaction may come as a surprise when i say that i personally am at a loss as to the heightened sensitivity displayed towards austria in matters of respect for human rights , having a sense of responsibility for one ' s own past , and the stability of democracy .	1.0872325198583628
lastly , his proposal would not give any passport to management companies which do not want to render isd activities .	1.0872325182520632
the path which the commission is walking is , in fact , obvious .	1.0876550730134034
and yet , in the chapter on aid and training for refugees , the report marks a step backwards from the initial text by stipulating that they no longer apply to refugees as such but to " refugees within the meaning of the geneva convention " .	1.1057654499885523
providing support for culture meets with wide - spread acceptance , and this certainly cannot be said of all policy decisions .	1.0872325197962203
i believe that otc instruments could lead to problems , because they are not liquid , the price is difficult to estimate and they entail uncovered counterparty risks .	1.0008747295088425
the first is the potential for renationalisation of competition policy .	1.429876908488498
it is high time that institutions restricted their scope to actual cross - border issues and stopped decking out the european cart with powers which they are taking away from national authorities .	1.6825897292477368
i am aware , and the previous speaker highlighted this , that there are states in the european union that have problems with water .	1.5685364590094064
we must create a permanent and truly independent , excellent and transparent system of risk assessment .	1.22629150969757
after all , we find ourselves in a situation of historic importance , that is to say , we are negotiating or are on the point of taking up negotiations with 12 states , and together we have reached a stage at which closer european integration may be a reality in the not too distant future .	1.1386611644104434
on 14 december 1999 , a five year - old boy called clément was found in a sleeping - car on the calais - ventimiglia train , crying for his mother who was taking him to visit his sick grandmother .	1.0871782653301096
mr president , nine million cars are shredded and scrapped every year in europe .	1.0002651973737346
after all , it is responsible for technical measures to protect against counterfeiting .	1.1545187875697558
if the limits are exceeded because of a one - sided quest for effectiveness , then the legitimising basis of the european union will suffer .	1.0872325182355036
an ' s ' has been omitted and instead of reading ' la propuesta nos parece correcta ' , it reads ' la propuesta no parece correcta ' which is completely the contrary .	1.0848840855618356
for these reasons , we are going to vote in favour of the report .	1.1514300998988722
i am also delighted to be able to confirm that i shall be participating in the joint assembly ' s next meeting , which takes place in march in nigeria .	1.063650832616937
nor can i understand the pressure applied by parliament to include the funds in chapter 7 for the pre - accession strategy . how can the whole of the european union treat , in this way , two small countries situated on its periphery ?	1.0871254396340315
the european parliament ' s opinion on the activities of the acp - european union joint assembly has always had a major impact , undeniably contributing to a consistent policy and role for the european union in development and cooperation .	1.557037041090941
my question to the president - in - office is twofold .	1.3316000076944887
madam president , despite the fundamental democratic principle of the respect for human rights and the freedom and sovereignty of peoples , which opposes fascism , nazism or communism , both new and old , and despite all the previous speakers talking about the sovereignty of the austrian people , we are today witnessing this sovereignty being denied by parliament .	1.0102755217451886
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the directive on the approximation of the laws of the member states with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road , which entered into force on 1 january 1997 , contains a number of transitional provisions which are only valid for a limited period of time , the term of validity being linked to the completion of specific standardisation work by the cen , that is the european committee for standardisation .	2.383303921455862
in fact , does the european union have a human rights policy ?	1.0059592267112667
. i would stress that no gmos have been approved under this directive ; it applies only to additives .	1.0011099354568136
mr president , i want to thank the co - president of the joint acp - eu assembly , mr corrie . it was no easy task to draw up a report on a complicated forum like the acp - eu assembly .	1.5486474032000541
you have not highlighted the ageing of our population which will fundamentally alter the structure of our society , not only economically but also in terms of public health .	1.0055641540016493
from now on europe must put its words into action if it wishes to show the world the scope of its rediscovered ambition .	1.0172131790564949
i can show you a copy if you wish .	1.4469444973917542
it appears that there is agreement and support with regard to the prioritisation of south - east europe , with regard to enlargement and - as i have said already - with regard to the process of integration and the strengthening of the euro - mediterranean programme and our ability to prevent conflicts , as well as an issue which we seldom talk about ; the north - south challenge .	1.0173597622517117
thank you , mr poettering .	1.470782402362423
this is repulsive most of all in social terms .	1.0872327720367785
mr president , it is our opinion that one facet of the construction of europe hinges on the construction of a common judicial system , for the europe that we want to build , which comprises administrative law , civil law , both substantive and procedural , and criminal law , both substantive and procedural .	1.1619909911931303
culture 2000	1.0238935434451168
this aid must be aligned with the objectives of the union , particularly economic and social cohesion , sustainable development and research .	1.083807540821466
the commission has no instruments to enforce any particular decrease or increase in excise taxes on alcoholic products or on any other products .	1.0838126267908932
the universal service will be able to fulfil its social mission only if it retains an area of monopoly enabling it to balance its budget .	1.1982960118444883
mr president , in terms of human rights , there is of course a great deal amiss in chechnya .	1.0714932378924775
it is just such practical cooperation there is a need for .	1.012878417176715
i also wonder about the wisdom of the eu and its reaction to the formation of the government in austria and how that is going to affect public opinion there .	1.0302010028633977
( parliament adopted the resolution )	2.0918275939659643
as i have understood it , there has been a certain lack of clarity in some respects as to how this is to be understood .	1.001626550326753
we all know that , in 1995 , it was agreed that the union ' s financial interests should be given better protection under criminal law .	1.5584530637494056
i can see the complexities that concern the honourable member , but i say to him that in the last five years there have been ten cases in which there have been requests from national legal authorities for the immunity of 26 officials to be lifted , and every single one of those requests has been met , and met with alacrity .	1.1271247870700183
to that end , the commission has commissioned studies on the cost of universal services , the consequences of liberalising cross - border mail and direct mail , the consequences of reducing weight and cost limits in the reserved sector , the consequences of liberalising the other phases of the postal process , excluding distribution , and an overall appraisal of the results of those studies .	1.5427937989930116
we must be very aware of the situation of those people whose prospects of finding work are threatened or reduced by economic changes , mergers , take - overs , new technologies etc .	1.176999277339774
we are doing it in order to try to explain in the fullest terms the system into which they will be entering .	1.0346699191893864
. ( sv ) the basic values common to the member states of the european union are based upon democracy , human freedoms and rights , and a social market economy .	1.346764965164324
by this i mean that there are aspects of the form and procedure of the community institutions ' workings which are not accessible to the other institutions , and not only as regards the commission ' s relationship with parliament , but also as regards the commission ' s relationship with the council .	1.0872301180937278
madam president , as my dear friend elly will know , i will do anything to make her and my dutch colleagues happy .	1.1279048001436518
so , first of all , we need to keep the recycling percentages at their present level . this will , of course , provide the necessary incentive for technological innovation and for identifying ways of dealing with materials that we do not as yet know how to dispose of .	1.2488346387644202
the foodstuffs legislation in the european union is the most ambitious in the world .	1.087506324434991
it provides a framework within which we can prevent any further deterioration , protect ecosystems , promote sustainable water use , help to fight floods and drought and gradually eliminate the disposal of dangerous substances .	1.0142606090075674
by adopting these amendments , parliament will allow recourse to otc derivatives but will also limit the risk to private investors .	1.0871320953566361
well , the syrians are quite possibly cutting off their nose to spite their face .	1.0034613337943534
more specifically , however , i would like to express our delight at the fact that , after such a long time , israel and syria are on speaking terms again to resolve their differences of opinion .	1.0084012099403366
computer - controlled selling programmes turned a random blip into an avalanche , burying jobs , lives and industries across the globe .	1.0872325198317052
my third criticism stems from the first two . the weakness of the analysis and the obstacles to the necessary changes have resulted in a project whose scope is severely limited by an overabundance of generalisations , a rather indecisive approach and therefore a lack of impetus .	1.0872295571906636
this is a perfect example of the sort of work we do not want to see .	1.0048321627868948
mr president , concerning item 11 of the minutes on the order of business , we agreed yesterday to have the bourlanges report on today ' s agenda .	1.000627040285028
mr president , commissioner , i second all those who expressed their solidarity with the storm victims .	1.9417100430830376
this represents the most important step forward in the stabilisation and association process of the western balkans region initiated by the commission in may 1999 .	1.0871290500696003
it is easy for individual countries , for individual sectors of industry , to escape the effects which have been painted to us in recent days .	1.0163939415860435
i want to concentrate on kosovo .	1.020751593114627
what are the values of the french socialist party , which extorted money from all the town councils under its thumb in the urba , sages and graco scandals ?	1.1185778156177975
by this i mean , of course , the internal dynamics of the european union .	1.0872358655604517
in my opinion , this is mainly down to the wrangling between the two major groups within our committee on budgetary control .	1.4412490710197219
in that sense , the agreement we will be voting on tomorrow , which contributes towards stability in the area , is de facto a move in the right direction .	1.6857978403102862
on the contrary , it will allow the interests of all concerned to be highlighted as and when cyprus joins the european union and prepares for a turning point in its history .	1.523234894982369
that is not guaranteed .	1.003648811939995
instead of allowing post office outlets to be undermined by liberalisation or by the modernisation of systems , governments , and the commission too , should be encouraging and supporting the extensive network of post office outlets and viewing these as an asset which can be built upon , providing public information and services from a location which is convenient for residents .	1.0250884576606045
i have referred to a series of issues which i will lay out in more detail , if you wish , in an appearance before a special committee on this matter , or when i present the actual initiatives in the coming months .	1.0917885994109955
that puts enlargement in danger . it jeopardises any prospect of political union and , of course , it is difficult for the public to understand .	1.087232519831682
would you be so kind as to write to me so that i have proof with which to tackle the competent authorities of both air france and the french government ?	1.316246249104306
however , we must ensure that competition distortions are not created , as highlighted by mr kindermann and mrs auroi .	1.5055262881526734
that is why , when we look at the eu financial perspective between 1989 and 1993 , and 1994 and 1999 , we find such a large proportion of the eu budget was put aside for the administration of the european regional development fund and the european social fund .	1.2892384278382922
b5 - 0179/2000 by mrs schroedter and others on behalf of the group of the greens/european free alliance	1.087231454009927
madam president , mr president of the commission , i have read and re - read the commission ' s document setting out the strategic objectives for its term in office .	1.6876213440648602
amongst these , firstly , is the fact that , despite trying to modernise articles 81 and 82 , article 81 and not article 82 carries exclusive weight .	1.087176804369859
because they have a different level of education .	1.2178660627526072
on the question of the indigenous peoples in the us , i am sure that the resolution which was primarily addressed to the us authorities will have been noted by them .	1.5477851177247712
which is why the environmental aspect , which is becoming a matter of urgency , must be taken into account in all development projects at all costs .	1.2318662876865054
unfortunately , and as everyone recognised during the military action in kosovo , there were civilian sectors , and in particular infrastructural sectors directly affecting the general public , and even inhabited areas , which were directly affected by nato air attacks .	1.0837168604193732
once again there are special areas of policy - making which should be left to the domain of the national member states .	1.0871581024001888
however , the european court of justice did not make specific reference to the issue of visa requirements and conditions of residence and consequently the member states were unable to clarify this issue .	1.1568381808601504
thank you for listening .	1.0015623216053124
mr president , mrs theato ' s report on the protection of the european union ' s financial interests proposes centralising criminal proceedings by initially creating a european public prosecutor .	1.045312096417877
this new disaster raises the problem of the integration of the environmental acquis communautaire in candidate countries .	1.087233399195154
the commission will keep a close watch on the greek government in order to ensure that it honours the commitments which it has made .	1.0041518711073187
that is one of the political conclusions that we must draw from the grave decision of 14 member states yesterday virtually to freeze relations with a partner .	1.1558381921974803
in matters relating to the health and safety of the people of the european union , the european commission , as guardian of the treaties and the only institution with the right of initiative , must be in a position to react very rapidly , if necessary within a few hours or days .	1.1048655455550076
amendments nos 6 and 21 are new ; the commission can approve these .	1.0469925830473974
böge report ( a5 - 0023/2000 )	1.1785541220733267
no specific target date for the implementation of this principle was included in the common position .	1.0873308260316152
i therefore invite the members of parliament who form the great majority , those who last november ruled that the future of europe was deserving of debates that went far wider than the amsterdam leftovers , to take up their pilgrims ' staffs and go and convince their own governments that this igc must be extended , since this is permitted according to the resolution of the helsinki council .	1.0872663431204197
so our clear response is that , yes , such aid and such agreements are legitimate , but we say that every single one of these agreements must be expressly justified .	1.0872324389719028
i think , therefore , that vintage cars ought to be exempt .	1.6035954039126272
i consider the casting of jörg haider as " europe ' s scapegoat " ( or even worse , neo - nazi and super racist ) to be counterproductive .	1.0065699556984051
for example , my brother - in - law , who lives in rome , started drawing his pension a year ago and every day since - from seven in the morning when he wakes until midnight - he has checked the tv screen to see how the pensions funds and the securities in which he has invested are performing .	1.0153947808957446
the commission can also accept amendment no 4 in principle .	1.203220244334391
our policies in africa lack coherence .	1.0046879323741384
this is also typical of a policy which makes citizens wonder what brussels actually does ?	1.0081242858172972
turning now to the question posed by mr alavanos , who i hope will pardon me for this brief diversion onto another subject , the commission has been monitoring and will continue to monitor , during the preparation of the new programming period , the application of the partnership principle .	1.3957056073838061
the overall objective therefore of the white paper on food safety is to put in place the necessary legislation and structures that will guarantee the highest possible level of health protection for consumers arising from the consumption of food .	1.0872294963107239
we hope that the events in el ejido will serve as a lesson to everyone and will not be repeated .	1.393209249329397
but it was above all the result of a stronger acp group , which obviously found new courage following the events in seattle .	1.0141411776441793
an important element of life - nature , which mainly concerns the realisation of the natura 2000 network , is the introduction of a multinational approach to formulating plans for international projects and activities , so as to avoid the fragmentation of biotopes and to offer better protection of biodiversity .	1.0872296321064425
my apologies once again for my mistake .	1.0871383643176942
question no 3 by ( h - 0027/00 ):	1.0873398210125467
i also want at this stage to say that i was able to propose this initiative to the commission thanks to the cooperation and understanding of my colleague , viviane reding . this initiative was also established in conjunction with günter verheugen as it involves all the major challenges of enlargement , both its opportunities and risks , and of institutional reform .	1.0024595330013761
mr corbett set out parliament ' s concerns .	1.087232443314433
we have heard anxieties expressed on that point and i will ensure it is taken up .	1.014102348682319
in short , we face a major challenge in meeting our commitments on limiting greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector under the kyoto protocol , while at the same time promoting growth in our economies .	1.3039872216693906
all these costs added together would be horrendous and would have repercussions for the agricultural sector .	1.0872325198317052
furthermore , the idea of obtaining resources to apply them to the more economically needy countries presents such complexity , when we consider their application in practice , that it appears simply impossible .	1.0054144285683109
one of the issues that we may have to address over time is the question of the speed of response in such circumstance .	1.0942592878349913
these cases keep occurring .	1.087117460207572
but the lack of specific guidelines here is particularly to be regretted , as the idea of linking social fund assistance to the employment strategy will be put into effect for the first time during the 2000 - 2006 programme .	1.0850190742602899
but we also believe that , in many cases , the proposals put forward by the commission and the council represent too much of a step backwards , which is why we would like to see a vote balanced between the various requirements in the proposals presented to us .	1.0101920782520892
extremely few members of the directorate - general for development , that is to say unit managers and more senior managers , have taken part in the gender courses that have been organised .	1.0894532019189784
stand firm on the demand for mobility , not as a right , as it says here in the report , but as a management tool .	1.0872296546876963
this was the first pillar of my recommendation .	1.0092112199133494
i see no reason why european union member states cannot work to implement the key provisions of this directive in as short a time as possible .	1.5810328841400867
i should now , mr president , like to bring up the subject of interreg and to thank the rapporteur , francis decourrière , in the same way that i thanked arlene mccarthy , for the quality and relevance of his work .	1.0896445496764415
amendments nos 13 , 28 , 32 , 37 , 42 and 48 involve introducing unnecessary conditions and exceptions .	1.0883642705455225
but the question remains as to whether this accumulation of responsibilities exceeds even his level of competence .	1.0022632640166966
they also play a major role in maintaining links between people .	1.0838388838316853
on the contrary , you are deriding the true victims of national socialism and playing down what the fascist dictators did .	1.1978464163523475
once again , we are losing a piece of our planet ' s cultural and ecological heritage , despite the many treaties and resolutions on human rights , on the protection of minorities , rights of indigenous peoples , etc ., which have already been ratified .	1.026868306464651
as for the southern stocks of anchovy in ices zone ix , the tac was fixed at 10 000 tonnes for the whole of 2000 as opposed to 13 000 tonnes in 1999 .	1.0037943903212696
this will determine the success of our work .	1.0838123484136049
equally i understand the commissioner failing to endorse such a tax , but i cannot understand why he failed to have the courage to welcome the opportunity to demonstrate the truth of his position by a study of the issue .	1.0839264403616382
i would like to remind you that these initiatives are aimed , firstly , in the case of urban , at improving the quality of life of the citizens who live in the poorer parts of various european cities , and , in the case of interreg , at facilitating cohesion and recognising the diversity and potential of the regions of the european union , particularly by including the outermost regions in strands b and c .	1.2643590525521844
there is a delay in adopting the interreg guidelines in march or april 2000 .	1.0049866637527953
as vaclav havel rightly said today , the european union will be judged on its political qualities according to what it can do for the individual .	1.0297886638098086
the legislative programme is , in fact , a litany of subjects over which the people are to be deprived of influence and in connection with which , mr prodi , you are to take influence away from the people , even on social questions .	1.0597045171811261
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :	2.280227532775717
the postal services are important .	1.0801739356929474
in addition , there is a clear tendency , in matters of international jurisdiction , more and more often to obtain a pure eu jurisdiction .	1.1712445917589833
i also hope that the same is done in relation to parliamentary control .	1.7130189067835204
since then , the fisheries council meeting of 16 december decided on drastic reductions in the total allowable catches for certain species such as cod and anchovy which were in the region of 25 percent for cod and 43 percent for anchovy for the year 2000 .	1.4468635978893658
we could say that , in this state of affairs , we have once again missed the opportunity to really strengthen sustainable urban development by ring - fencing ever - increasing urbanisation and , hence the destruction of the countryside .	1.0909900040256078
the second development which we regard as important is the statement made by the secretary - general of the united nations at the end of the first day ' s discussions to the effect that an overall settlement of the situation would involve recognition of the specific situation of the north of the island .	1.0871226433667618
any analysis of economic development in recent years , if objective , will show , through the figures , that they have no political colour or orientation .	1.0872668016640215
mr president , commissioner , i would firstly like to highlight the excellent work carried out by mrs berger and the committee on legal affairs and the internal market generally , which has incorporated innovative ideas into this directive , which i hope will be approved by the commission and the council .	2.0173329516506016
we stand ready to assist in this assessment if there is a joint request from hungary and romania and if access to the sites for nationals of both countries can be guaranteed . that is obviously crucial .	1.3386592841197564
with all due respect to a commissioner as effective as mr fischler , and given that we have heard contradictory comments , depending on the translation , with regard to a possible request by president prodi for the resignation of mr fischler , i would be very grateful if this point could be clarified in this house .	1.2094612270844445
the situation of certain urban areas is alarming , with the social distress taking the form of unemployment , misery and crime .	1.0758014286717226
what can the commission do about that ?	1.2067673953073295
its borders are set not by how may countries want to join , but by how many countries it can accommodate .	1.0872325198317057
the legislative programme from the commission ought at least , therefore , to be accompanied by as long a list of tasks which are to be referred back to the member states and to the processes of popular democracy . otherwise , the number of laws produced in brussels will just keep on growing .	1.0335980105654536
should nato not at the very least acknowledge fault for its deliberate targeting of the belgrade tv tower and killing over 20 civilian journalists , which remains a severe moral blemish on the conduct of the war and now opens the embarrassment of a possible indictment for war crimes against our western leaders ?	1.0871264185755394
we will be happy to incorporate mr patten ' s notes into the bibliography , as another bedside book for the members to bear in mind .	1.0096170813217933
i am not saying that we do not need to raise the skills within the sector - of course we do - but let us get the jobs established first .	1.0298696526818019
my second question is of a critical nature .	1.6533765746484799
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , mr gallagher ' s report on the fourth amendment of the regulation on technical measures was not amended in our committee . it was actually approved unanimously for which i congratulate the rapporteur .	2.350235070213716
it is high time it was properly evaluated and that a system was set up which clearly identifies the eu ' s areas of competence .	1.212264306469285
in my view , the most important consequence , however , is that countries should do some careful thinking and , above all , make sure they send in their lists of natura 2000 sites .	1.2569115863322218
so we need to do this .	1.0920533814493494
i would like to make one last point in answer to mr harbour .	1.233977694966021
it is also a matter of conviction .	1.2983694132488917
an initial conciliation meeting was not successful , because the council would not at that time accept an increase of eur 1 . 9 million .	1.0872325198312331
needless to say , safety on roads , railways and inland waterways is of key importance and , given the international nature of these types of transport , training for safety advisors should also be harmonised , therefore , as well as the requirements of the new adr , for example , which is under way .	1.122724281524449
in this sense , the proposed amendments tabled by me and other members on behalf of the group represent an improvement on the demands set out in the common position .	1.7105023555377319
we express our support for the families and friends of the victims .	1.0215108242950892
mr president , when the doñana disaster occurred , the non - governmental organisation , the world wide fund for nature , gave us a report on the number of reservoirs of this type in europe .	1.015541122248303
the european union ' s contribution under the stability pact , now converted into what is called the " stabilisation and association process " , represents a development in the regional concept the european community drew up in 1996 for the five countries of the region : bosnia and herzegovina , croatia , the federal republic of yugoslavia , the former yugoslav republic of macedonia and albania . its most significant aspect was the establishment of political and economic conditions intended to support the implementation of the dayton peace agreement , and it should therefore contribute to regional stability .	1.6481401128798718
i should therefore like to draw your attention in particular to the inclusion of increased numbers of vocational training measures , especially in areas with high levels of long - term and youth unemployment .	1.9903619847545233
needless to say , this is most definitely an essential point which should not be changed in any way .	1.1779953956946743
this latter issue may be particularly significant if it causes cost - push inflation . this is why we are continuing to talk about the need for a wages policy compatible with the definitions of inflation which we want to establish .	1.0872325198317052
i am certain that it will not be disappointed , having given us its support , and i personally undertake to keep parliament informed , as things progress , of the various phases of the implementation of our measures and the measures of our citizens , which i hope will be great measures for the future of the union .	1.3761648396699113
against this background of extremely high expectations , i do not think that i am exaggerating if i say that this first step , namely the stability and association agreement with macedonia , is vitally important .	1.0300953721200223
the debate is closed .	1.1675438313701068
thus , whether through the new deal in newcastle or fair trade in freetown , labour ' s aim of opportunity for all remains the same .	1.0911265119797025
experience in other areas has shown that preventative vaccination has the adverse affect of creating healthy virus carriers .	1.010814266613683
we must attempt to avoid that and establish the structures so as to ensure that there is a proper dissemination of information between scientists , that there is full consultation and discussion and that the authority at community level has the opportunity and is mandated to seek the advice and opinion of independent scientists in all member states and indeed maybe even beyond , where experts are to be found elsewhere .	1.0872325198317052
the time has come to implement the programmes , and so member states should also assume their responsibilities and do their jobs properly .	1.6540870978994529
nevertheless , i would like to add that with regard to cultural policy , and in particular the audiovisual dimension , the portuguese presidency will be paying very close attention to extending and enriching european audiovisual policy by adopting a media - plus programme which could go some way towards allaying europe ' s main fears .	2.821980118520435
i hope that this community initiative will help serve as an example on how to resolve the problems faced by the elderly in cities .	1.2148119850336367
as you know , on monday an unmanned spacecraft went into orbit around a peanut - shaped asteroid called eros which is not very far from earth .	1.1595367608217961
the overarching objectives of the structural funds such as job creation , boosting equality of opportunity , increasing the sustainability of employment and development , are only mentioned in passing .	1.0871244924032457
the council , commission and parliament are all agreed on the content but there is disagreement on the transitional period for implementing the directive .	1.0045006823618312
it is also because liberalisation is necessary in order to be able to keep up with technological advances and , moreover , because it will lead to lower prices . all that , we are assured , will be more easily attained in a free and competitive market .	1.0124865213868248
i believe that as equal partners the eu - and acp - elected delegates are up to that task .	1.019196090545508
we are currently working on it in the commission and when that work is done i will report on it , as many have been asking if it will be possible to see the report on coherence .	1.1453808204952696
there is nothing to indicate that the member states ' legal principles , legal traditions and carefully tailored legal systems should be lost for reasons to do with an already familiar offence such as counterfeiting . nor , in the light of the international convention of 20 april 1929 , can there be any confusion as to which country should deal with any criminal cases .	1.4360388836181446
relating to friday , on friday morning we have an oral question on postal services and the group of the party of european socialists is requesting that the motions for resolutions should be put to the vote immediately after the debate and not in brussels , as envisaged in the final version of the draft agenda .	1.1864509062004442
i also want to move towards a linear career system because the current category system is no longer adapted to the needs of our institutions .	1.0696774884497218
the statements we have heard today on the middle east peace process are very opportune at the moment because of the hurried tour which minister gama - whose absence from this debate i also regret - has made of the region , accompanied by other council representatives .	1.087240048271414
under the system proposed in these pieces of legislation , third country nationals wishing to move to the uk under the procedures described , will do so by virtue of the service provision card issued by another member state , thereby by - passing uk border controls .	1.0872325198933297
is that the message we want to send out ?	1.0034493000354912
only a public mail service can guarantee that information technology is within everyone ' s reach in society .	1.0872325198317052
i therefore extend my special thanks to my colleagues in the group who helped us find compromises .	1.0885503739699978
furthermore , as you know , the european union makes a contribution to the united nations high commission for refugees , which came to eur 66 . 3 million in 1999 .	1.0291717375954939
i want the assembly to stop being just a talk - shop and become a work - shop for the betterment of all the people in developing countries .	1.0035750151638914
the financial regulation is the legal framework we need to tackle the priorities established under the terms of the accession partnerships with malta and cyprus .	1.0566069134106244
finally , the european union must be responsible for monitoring the application of its principles .	1.0191193226595225
i have received 8 motions for resolution , in accordance with rule 37 ( 2 ), to close the present commission statement .	1.01974019906362
here , in my opinion , the labour market is also considerably burdened by the costs arising to these companies .	1.013258423793951
other issues have been mentioned : cattle - farming in namibia , tomatoes and milk powder in the caribbean .	1.0146951361401717
in its present form , the report will contribute to further liberalisation of the capital markets , in spite of the fact that what is most important is to restrain them .	1.911642608435033
i would simply like to say that the portuguese presidency has , in these two short months , organised the first development council , admittedly an informal one , whose agenda was rightly dominated by eu - africa relations . indeed it was this subject which led the development ministers of the fifteen member states to meet in lisbon for discussions specifically on the new era these relations have entered .	2.347688246313393
i will ensure that we go further than the rather dry terms of the commission ' s text and it will certainly be more a question of sharing the work than working in liaison with each other . i will also ensure that over the next two years we can coordinate the initiatives taken by yourselves and ourselves which will be separate but joint .	1.3622758987955563
specifically , i must stress in this debate the plan for morocco . this is a country with which the european union has an effective relationship and common interests and which should take particular priority in mutual cooperation and collaboration .	1.0850386591927403
he said that there would always be unanimity on social questions but , in the commission ' s draft , plans are quite explicitly being made for majority decision - making on issues relating to social security and on taxes connected with the internal market . this means that it will be possible for major parts of the social systems in the member states to be changed by a majority in brussels , even if a unanimous french national assembly , a british house of commons and a dutch lower house should be against this .	1.0157913048925598
the pse group of this house has suggested that preventing natural disasters , including preventing conflicts , is the best way of avoiding situations like the one now being suffered by the people of mozambique .	1.0689544551043169
in our society there is no such thing as zero - risk , but we must at least ensure the greatest possible levels of safety .	1.0221711879836421
with regard to the dialogue with our citizens , it is not a question of propaganda or marketing , nor even of communication .	1.4340865236410292
i agree with the rapporteur and am able to say that the environment committee has asked the committee on agriculture and rural development to agree to the commission proposal .	1.8253238476118485
i propose that we start the debate immediately .	1.382830208620033
it is , of course , only in this way that we can create a future for the car industry .	2.603478583630945
externalising services by subcontracting these to contract companies results in stable and permanent jobs being turned into precarious jobs without union or social rights .	1.0872325198317052
so today we find ourselves in a state of utter confusion .	1.0877628714256273
i would like to express my sympathy with all those who are dealing with the consequences of the breaking up and sinking of the oil tanker erika .	1.2605497703406163
the only way of stopping the diabolical machine which produces capital gains on the one side and unemployment on the other is to ban redundancies in all large companies which are in profit , on pain of compulsory purchase , and to publish the accounts of large companies and subject them to the scrutiny of the workers and the general public .	1.2914893876182936
it is a quite different europe which is taking shape in the long term .	1.006364713918252
whether through the minimum wage in manchester or debt relief in durban , labour ' s aim of poverty reduction remains the same .	1.0873051447203077
the emphasis should have been placed on the rejection of any policy of handouts and instead on the development of initiative and responsibility .	1.0871308142226392
we were able to put a stop to the mass expulsion campaign carried out by the serbs but almost every day insupportable things happen : people are killed , people are prevented from living there or are prevented from living their lives as they see fit .	1.3285250334967993
now to the form . on the subject of the role of the guidelines , mrs schroedter , you pointed out that this is the context in which guidelines on a number of european objectives , often very precise ones , should be provided .	1.0054810589565115
can you confirm the agreement made by your services in the committee on budgets , yes or no ? or are you going to drop this proviso , thus breaking the undertaking made to us ?	1.0872325198318096
the reform will lead to a gradual development - i stress this because i was particularly taken with this term , used by mrs randzio - plath , and , moreover , i fully agree with it - of european competition culture .	1.011903009790301
i would also like to say that the position of the fourteen states emanating from the council was justified , as in a way this is also a matter of the composition of the government of the european union , meaning this is also a matter for the council and not merely an internal affair of austria ' s .	2.263842568473015
with regard to amendments nos 5 and 6 , i want to emphasise that projects for the sustainable exploitation of groundwater and surface water , together with projects for reducing forms of air pollution which contribute to the greenhouse effect , are to a large degree covered by life .	1.0040094316616304
on the whole , i welcome the committee ' s proposals set out in mrs lienemann ' s report and think they could provide a good basis for a hard - won compromise .	1.4622908716098193
one of the reasons for the community ' s interest is the structural flexibility of this sector of the employment market , which explains its attractiveness for women and young people , to whom it often offers their first experience of employment .	1.1818160586790405
we hope that this , at the least , will come about during the evaluation process .	1.3047858904709184
there are poor regions within the union which need to be given european assistance to improve the fabric of their economies so that they can compete within the european union structure .	1.0872294931696997
this is why the mid - term review , provided for under article 42 of regulation 1260/99 , will be of considerable importance .	1.258825171068806
in 1953 , we suffered an enormous flood at a time when we were able to play a pioneering role in terms of dam technology .	1.087232519832739
in this first speech , i would like to share with parliament the commission ' s view of the most important events in 1999 .	1.087154697381883
yes , e - europe will be the future for us because it will help us create new prosperity and new jobs .	1.0871637303566186
in my opinion , we now have to make a significant and urgent effort to confront new problems , also deriving from american legislation , which emphasise the safety of the transport of dangerous goods in the maritime sector .	1.2877672592970821
the austrian people ' s party , which i represent here in this parliament , used to be and still is a party that has consistently spoken up for the integration of my country into the eu and feels deeply attached to the community of values that is the european union , and likewise its basic political principles of deepening and enlargement .	2.8369049233593575
the present position is more dramatic in terms of displaced populations , and in terms of a whole raft of economic factors and of the level of satisfaction with basic health facilities resulting from the overall breakdown in organisational structures in kosovo ' s administration .	1.0872325197840198
it would be obscene to wish to settle the fate of hundreds of thousands of postal workers , millions of service users , in a great rush .	1.0043567508405804
there must be flexibility .	1.189549073953745
mr president , i am also pleased to welcome the spanish commissioner , mr solbes mira , whom i have congratulated more than once , inside and outside this parliament , on the excellent work he did in spain on the subject of european convergence .	1.5558688859748055
i shall deal with each of the individual amendments separately .	1.0872650005744875
madam president , on a point of order .	1.210538129137532
however , in order for such an effort to succeed it is necessary to secure the commitment and participation of the public as a whole and to enlist the support of the less active social groups and the groups particularly affected by the economic and social crisis .	1.200264631922092
mr president , we are indeed now in a very rare situation : those who wish to uphold environmental values will take the side of the council in their common position .	1.1799847869069615
we seem unable to make a serious contribution to the development of the least developed countries .	1.0872295760736588
we need , in our judgement , to focus on a package of measures including : first , the introduction of effective , anti - discrimination legislation at union level ; second , implementation of a common immigration policy with regard to the nationals of non - member states to promote , in practical terms , the integration of the immigrant population in member states ' societies ; third , the introduction of measures to combat social exclusion .	1.3863829845152875
i therefore cannot see any reason why article 22 , paragraph 3 should be omitted and reject the amendment for this reason .	1.0871461411098367
there was also deep satisfaction on both sides when this was over , not just because it was over , but because we all knew that we had achieved something together , the eu and the 71 acp countries .	1.0194807851448393
mr president , commissioner , water is a precious natural asset , a vital necessity , and it is our duty to protect it .	1.778004632139565
all we would have to do is get a directory of development and put all the items in our programme , one after the other .	1.0901302608070456
what point is there in issuing restrictive directives if , once they are at sea , most vessels do just what they wish ?	1.0872325198317045
our parliament first asked experts to help it evaluate the performance of the european commission and they took advantage of this invitation to determine , themselves , what its future should be .	1.0872325198317139
what do we expect from a government in any case ?	1.0042280583688163
so , the reform will lead to the various national competition cultures being transplanted and taking root in the european competition culture - where today various small plants thrive , and they are certainly not all the same .	1.0063521360014143
i believe a liberalised market will speed up this process more than a less liberalised market .	1.0120971183355232
it points out some of the serious flaws in this proposal .	1.0883202516406691
hence his disappearance of over one month .	1.087232517803243
the content of the agreements has progressed steadily between lomé i and lomé vi .	1.4365293347657047
we respect and accept the discussion that is taking place and also appreciate the concerns that are being voiced in many of our member states as to the way ahead for austria .	1.0872325197884898
decades will have gone by before we are able to determine the true extent of the damage sustained by the forestry industry .	1.08723253777333
one is to ensure high quality training , another is to ensure that no directorate - general can take over financial control responsibilities unless and until the auditor service is absolutely certain of the robustness of the system , another is the establishment of a central financial service , as honourable members will see from the white paper , to ensure that those standards are set and supervised , and there is also the additional belt and braces and boilersuit approach of having an effective and independent internal audit service .	1.0063057785441258
madam president , it would really be very difficult to imagine a debate which is more in accordance with rule 50 of our rules of procedure .	1.0789394091834752
mr president , high representative , commissioner , with regard to the war in chechnya , we have all noted the particularly restrained and almost accommodating reaction of the international community in general and of the european union in particular .	1.0040930701189859
as a supplementary question , i should like to ask you whether , as the portuguese presidency , you have made provision for the rights of children , as such , to be included in future deliberations and the rights to be incorporated in the charter .	1.0917457356866491
the white paper on food safety outlines a comprehensive range of actions needed to complement and modernise existing eu food legislation .	1.6509585717394193
firstly , the liability of owners of oil cargoes must be clearly established and the victims of pollution incidents must be able to claim on this liability unequivocally .	1.0054001445639813
i know that some people say we must have a better way of pressing our concern about human rights than through tabling resolutions .	1.008203594160305
i want to congratulate him , sadly in his absence , for the thorough and rigorous way in which he has undertaken the preparation of his report - and also for putting up with my being such a thorn in his side !	1.0021049693055097
this also applies , for example , to the very real projects which the committee on industry has introduced .	1.1023463184093427
there is a possibility , which has not yet been absolutely confirmed , that continuous and direct discussions may take place , with work continuing until september this year .	1.0051860342162307
i would like to thank the minister and the commissioner for their speeches and for committing themselves before the european parliament on the crucial matter we are discussing today .	1.503777626146386
yet , the sum of eur 378 million you mentioned had been given in 1999 , was proved by the facts to be quite insufficient to create even rudimentary civilised conditions in kosovo , especially where the provision of health services is concerned .	1.0871282502884958
more controls would be placed to prevent oil spillages such as that of the erika in the bay of biscay and also deliberate dumping of waste oils .	1.0872325198317152
this is the european union , not the soviet union .	1.1399530378726639
we need structural reforms in the european economy .	1.08734753527528
we are convinced that the cornerstone of successful adaptation to change is dialogue at all levels and with full and transparent information as its basis .	1.5360406827813466
a council regulation that is directly applicable law must also be observed by the regional governments .	1.0386437295922466
eleven thousand job losses at hoechst and rhone - poulenc , twenty two thousand at unilever , ten thousand at abb/alsthom power , not to mention all the others .	1.0872325198317052
i hope that the projects included within the programmes can help to provide solutions to these problems and to implement in practical terms the principle of free movement of workers which is in a bad way in my region !	1.4461221615957833
this proposal for a regulation is supposed to be one of these legal bases !	1.6071193293361576
commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the group of the greens/european free alliance are pleased with the agreement which has been found , and their thanks go to all those who negotiated so well in favour of an amendment which the greens were almost the authors of .	1.5127446989392674
it will form the framework for emergency assistance for combating war damage if such action should be needed .	1.0837339623864055
this is where we want to go .	1.0408991531675493
as this is the first valentine ' s day of the new millennium i hope that you will agree with me that it would be fitting for this house to mark this day by making a firm commitment to tackling heart disease , the biggest killer in the european union .	1.2488233718688466
these are three areas in which many danish companies are experiencing major problems and are being squeezed out of their markets .	1.0872295510854135
we anticipate , if i understand correctly , a report in september on core activities .	1.0873035476329387
( the sitting was closed at 7 . 40 p . m .)	2.163068434271307
the only guarantee has been to seek prior favourable approval , through individual cases , which will take more than six or eight months to resolve , an excessively long period , which simply leads to problems of a lack of flexibility , affecting the generation of wealth and employment .	1.0872295726589445
mr president , i too should like to thank the council and the commission for their reports and , in common with others , express my regret at the fact that coherence policy has not been given more prominence .	1.5037795243571774
not a word was said by these same eu governments about coalition governments involving fellow - travelling communists in french or italian governments , or in german state governments , or even the british government ' s willingness to promote those with terrorist associations as ministers in northern ireland today .	1.0872300292601844
there is also an argument for introducing early notification obligations as well as having this card .	1.0133283248128702
to support this statement , i would point to an excellent report drafted by our colleague , mário soares , in the international bodies on the state of the seas and oceans .	1.0105140112152324
for these are prerequisite to any development .	1.009338818388329
but it is time for the legislation to be updated .	1.0050844455944488
this will make the commission itself more efficient and encourage the use of new technologies outside the commission .	1.3507273979919339
the importance of the tourist industry and its impact on employment - although everyone is now aware of this - is nevertheless based more on personal experience rather than on verifiable statistical data .	1.426707422127546
i would also thank mrs palacio most warmly for her major contribution as chairman of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market .	1.023917600358796
new rules have been drawn up and implemented governing the appointment of senior officials .	1.0872340667904774
following the attack in hadera on monday , we must repeat our condemnation of any form of terrorism .	1.0872325185784715
in point of fact , i consider this to be necessary because we heard , following the committee on legal affairs and the internal market ' s visit to luxembourg , that it is of course inevitable , a god - given fact as it were , that the court of justice should take precedence over the court of first instance when it comes to using the joint translation service , and so more often than not , important cases handled by the court of first instance cannot be given the attention they deserve .	1.08714505188797
for instance , the financial controller granted a positive a priori visa in most of the cases of mismanagement or irregularities recently uncovered .	1.3295487655362355
it was not able to do very much but it was repeatedly abused by members of this house proposing action when the disasters were not even major .	1.0129237139135183
mr president , a white paper , by definition , is not something you can take or leave .	1.0303730321175537
the aim at national and european level is to establish large action groups by tender , with a full description of the project for which external assistance is to be requested . we would expect from each technical office a full description of the product so that the work can be monitored and appraised .	1.0871344550415458
farmers have voiced a number of concerns over the past few days .	1.0872294931597257
she said that she had received a letter from the chinese ambassador , a very amiable and highly intelligent representative and servant of his country , to tell her that she was wrong and the european parliament was wrong in its attitude on human rights in china .	1.005561589281097
in connection with the intergovernmental conference , mr barnier said , during his presentation in parliament , that social policy was not to be subject to majority decision - making but , when i look at page 63 , i see that rights of travel and of residence - that is to say , the residence directives - , combating discrimination , the whole of social security and the renewal of regulation no 1408 and , with a few exceptions , of arrangements in the socio - political sphere are to be subject to qualified majority voting .	1.4344305934740367
we need that because the various european union bodies and all the member states within monetary union have to be able to depend on one another .	1.0872324451870459
but the fact that we now fear abuse of power and nepotism indicates that , unfortunately , democracy is not fully functioning yet .	1.0958015411938646
and that question will of course become increasingly pressing with the approach of 1 january 2002 , the date when they will have euros in their pockets .	1.0872294321471871
i come , of course , from a country that is proud of its car industry and of its commercial success both in europe and in third countries .	1.090633089785458
we are in the process of looking into this question and assessing what knowledge we have today and what it is possible to do .	1.7079808808865997
( sv ) we have abstained from voting for jan andersson ' s report on a coordinated strategy for modernising social security .	1.3709265205969794
mr president , commissioner , kosovo was hopefully the last occasion on which international law could be interpreted as saying that dictators could persecute minorities in the most repellent way on the grounds that " it is happening within their own nation " .	1.7777195583587588
that faces us with the very important challenge of offering the consumers cheaper postal services .	1.0871318567911354
we therefore welcome increased resources for olaf so that we can investigate any suspicions more efficiently .	1.0067572774109603
the commission considers that the convention responsible for drawing up the charter of fundamental rights must respect the mandate given by the cologne european council .	1.954886377360511
mr president , i would like to use the few seconds of speaking time to which i am entitled to point out , or remind , the representative of the commission that , in belgium , the government is currently pursuing a policy under which thousands and possibly tens of thousands of illegal aliens are being legalised and are to receive permanent right of residence , right to be reunited with their families , etc .	2.2066278989675197
this is all too familiar in many of our urban areas .	1.005417455632464
he is not always right , but in this case he is .	1.2350911394876078
if further regulation is needed , we feel that it could be better achieved by other means than those proposed in the directive .	1.0872305799616253
the commission has no means of influence here .	1.0841436531908648
at the same time , it also represents a quantum leap in qualitative terms , and a logical and vital step in the development of the union , in the wake of the establishment of the internal market , the introduction of the single currency and the launching of a common foreign and security policy .	1.6497022930873553
the great majority of the paper ' s proposals are closely akin to those put by mr van hulten and that paper includes - i say to him and to mr staes - a very explicit timetable of actions to be undertaken in pursuit of reform .	1.7357043038071047
it is not enough that all the world ' s industrialised countries should be included in the scheme , as then currency trading would move to tax havens outside that group of countries .	1.282654007432027
thank you , mrs fraga estévez .	1.3645910115439241
mr president , we need to get used to the idea in the 21st century that we have to show water a completely new respect .	1.1371030709009164
there are bound to be other applications and this great work , this fine intellectual architecture , will crumble , left behind by events just as we have been left behind by everything that has been happening in the former yugoslavia for the past 20 years .	1.0848301282124828
every time , when we asked why , the reply was the same , ' we cannot release him : he is a war criminal ' .	1.0119727073412863
i urge that car manufacturers should most definitely not be given the task of organising the dismantling and recycling of vehicles , as they would gain an excessive hold over the second - hand components market .	1.0875399016960081
in our report , we have highlighted the importance of combating poverty within the eu and of finding indicators as soon as possible so that we can make progress in this area .	1.1022662293809307
so the big test for us is going to be in the balkans . i hope that all those heads of government , all those prominent politicians in our member states who promised the earth in the balkans , who promised marshall plans and who make all the other promises in the balkans will be around when the budgetary authority decides how much we have got to spend in the balkans .	1.0872324456790572
today , they would have everything to lose from the communitarisation of foreign policy , and i believe that they are working with that in mind .	1.0871235967861308
it is most worrying , especially as a similar agreement with mexico appears to be taking shape .	1.0163368494559075
the people are holding demonstrations , they are sending us e - mails .	1.0128419765917474
when it comes to tourism , we can no longer do what we like where we like .	1.071975575867652
the council - and mr luis amado has said this this morning - has spoken on different occasions of the need for coherence - the last time , it is true , being in november 1999 , and also on other occasions , such as the development councils of may 1999 and june 1997 - but with no concrete results .	1.2961595447596985
commissioner byrne , it appears that you want to engage in a test of strength with parliament .	1.0290612639477805
the aid is primarily a windfall for incumbent regimes , and the poor majority does not benefit at all .	1.0083643436288827
although it seems a reasonable scheme , the tobin tax is not without its problems , even if there should be agreement as to its implementation , which i do not believe there will .	1.087232517903048
that situation will be compounded by social reclassifications resulting from european union enlargement , and we must therefore make provision for the economic regeneration and social cohesion of our cities .	1.0837917152034269
the unfettered rise in prices of financial assets and property means that the risks are on the increase .	1.0872325198317052
we therefore support the proposal to reduce the time allotted for implementing different parts of the directive .	1.1433715613234734
the council ' s ability to intervene in this matter is strictly limited .	1.025286319632343
mr president , public institutions must not accept only the economic criterion .	1.0011537598380313
it is particularly appropriate that mr monti is responding to this debate because the great conundrum with postal services is how to square an open market and free and fair competition with providing a service which is universally available to all , even in the remotest and least inhabited region of the european union .	1.0068324191419455
the prevalent theory that the enemy must be crushed and physically eliminated to achieve peace is not one which we can accept .	1.0872325198317052
last year ' s debate in new york on sovereignty and humanitarian intervention was such a sensitive topic that it influenced all other issues .	1.3171286167841953
this would make our rapporteur ' s life considerably easier in the future .	1.0843313263368948
we must therefore proceed with caution with regard to a document like the one from the council which , as the rapporteur himself has underlined , now claims , after years of discussion , to have found a universal solution in the space of a few months .	1.0107072888232274
you could hardly expect this commissioner to agree with a tax which would , in fact , impede international economic movement .	1.0872325198121955
transnational strategies are intended to make it possible for disadvantaged groups to have access to jobs .	1.0871308313385333
it has been done in a number of different areas but , unfortunately , the postal sector has remained the one major exception until now .	1.0382017217585309
just consider the facts : we looked at austria a while ago , but we can also look at the stock markets , mr president : given that the euro , that great undertaking , has fallen 16% against the dollar in a year , then perhaps , i will not say a government , but a good head of a family should ask himself whether one can conceivably tell the citizens that the only subjects open to negotiation are the number of commissioners or similar issues .	1.0872294311119863
my question in the first place concerns the opportunities the disabled have to take advantage of freedom of movement in europe .	1.0838054013396252
.	1.0835709380285035
the eu and the acp states will initiate the process aimed ultimately at defining , within a framework to be negotiated with each and every acp country , the ways and means of repatriating immigrants illegally present on the territories of each party .	2.0540274800190206
i believe that very little has been achieved in these three fields .	1.0037543943048883
one of the main differences in the comparison made recently between europe and the united states was not so much job mobility or risk capital , as women ' s involvement in economic life , an issue that has much more prominence in the united states than in europe . this is a field where europe has , nevertheless , always been in the vanguard .	1.1175422923662237
in addition to this one overture there is a second which we have already suggested to the member states : greater financial flexibility between strand a and strand b . thanks to these two overtures , especially the first , i can say that the commission is willing to examine the case of italian regions and regions of third countries around the adriatic in order to promote the most appropriate cooperation under interreg , and with other instruments too , as soon as they become available .	1.0523368818252206
resources should therefore be set aside from category seven , where a review of the financial perspectives must be carried out .	1.0840112403093314
we are convinced a rapid start to these negotiations and their speedy conclusion is the only way to achieve peace in the region - peace which did not automatically come with the end of the kosovo war - thus avoiding the recurrence of further disintegration and a return to chaos and violence , with all the consequences of that in terms of continental , if not world , instability .	1.0130103385233808
mr president , i hold mr florenz in high esteem .	1.4050331923007624
the first such report was presented to the council in may 1999 , and it referred to certain aspects of policy coordination , notably in the fields of peace building , food safety , fisheries and migration .	1.0872325983026543
i can only emphasise that these are the really hard nuts that finally need to be cracked .	1.0094414768175766
in the age of globalisation , which we do want to facilitate with a framework of specific rules that will provide guarantees to the economic operators and consumers , the european commission cannot forget solidarity , and must call for its implementation through the use of all of man ' s spiritual resources in his relations with his fellow man .	1.4281944240062838
europe , japan and the us - the euro , the yen and the dollar , would constitute , in my opinion , such a block .	1.0872325198340316
mrs karamanou , i recognise the fact that all the efforts that have been made in kosovo in this field have not been enough .	1.0291815400871012
i refuse to accept that we can now talk about a genocide in reverse - that is bending the truth .	1.00824141954568
vote	1.0835709380285035
first of all , in your view , does the common foreign and security policy aim to protect the security of the member states of the union , as one might think , or do you recognise their right to intervene anywhere in the world ?	1.3541914977488048
at midday , mr gama referred to the financial and commercial support provided by europe to the region .	1.0872325179343985
on the other hand , districts which have not been affected by the storms will also suffer , as the national forestry office has decided to freeze cuts in forestation for four years .	1.4711075966151839
these men paid with their lives for their commitment to democracy .	1.0872325198306285
in some of your amendments you propose that we limit further the type of bodies which can be provided with union funds , for example , amendments nos 3 and 5 .	1.0038231270561895
this discussion is not new .	1.0872293524897687
mr president , this is an extremely bad directive .	1.1474743467654078
president . i have received several proposed amendments relating to the topical and urgent subjects of major importance .	1.0902513329874683
turkey is only looking to increase its energy potential by 2% with this unit .	1.0872300235326289
i see the process not quite but almost as important as the content and we will put all our resources into participating actively and we invite everybody to participate .	1.0112917731943374
i would therefore like to ask the council and the commission what proposals they will be presenting at the forthcoming lisbon summit to ensure that the new economy and the new europe we want to build will definitely include equality between men and women .	2.2154801648422273
the next item is the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the conference of presidents , pursuant to rule 110 of the rules of procedure .	1.0967316950692965
at this time when we are voting on a joint resolution against the inclusion of neo - nazis in the government of a european union member state , i must express my regrets regarding a compromise text which is particularly lacking in backbone .	2.156707620189651
the amendment to the directive on today ' s agenda does not therefore affect the existing harmonisation of the transport of dangerous goods in the community .	1.3861263478599701
these include a comprehensive information gathering and surveillance function , the coordination of scientific information in the eu , and building up strong networks with food safety agencies and bodies in member states .	1.0872325198316792
i hope that parliament ' s participation in the geneva session turns out to be more than just a token presence and that its representatives do more than just listen to and give evidence . first and foremost they should use the occasion to affirm that we regard the aspects i have just mentioned as central to the identity of the european union and of the european nation , and that we also uphold the principle of the universality of human rights that transcends time and place .	1.0657409490070344
this also means that , in any case , i have a great deal of respect for the briefing note which she sent on 10 january but also for the action points which she announced today .	1.1019723203116976
our amendments from the first reading have , i believe , been taken into account very satisfactorily .	1.083708294055258
madam president , commissioner , i should like once again to say a few words on the modus operandi and the ideological tactics behind this oral question .	1.1743706301324648
however , if europe wants to take military action at crucial times , the treaty must include a flexibility clause .	1.0095245606638361
amendment no 10 which i tabled on behalf of my group refers to the concept of ' economic and social cohesion ' rather than ' regional development ' as the european union does not have any recognised competence in this area .	1.0366215915651533
nor is there coherence vis -à- vis the european taxpayer when we draft a development policy which is accommodated in the union ' s budget but the edf remains outside it .	1.0872338524682958
as for videoconferencing , more precise regulations must be established so that the rights of the defence and guarantees of fair trials are safeguarded .	1.0872325198308526
with regard to the judicial network , significant progress has been made , in particular the launch at the end of 1999 of the dedicated telecommunications system of the european judicial network , whilst the multi - disciplinary group has developed a series of actions to implement the 1997 action plan .	1.444753951002096
this applies to them and us .	1.0134550788583765
the commission is also of the opinion that a number of the amendments proposed by the committee on economic and monetary affairs would fundamentally change the content of the first proposal .	1.1681073635180794
on the other hand , it would be so difficult to bring the scheme into force everywhere in the world at precisely the same time - and personally speaking , i do not believe we can achieve this - that the tobin tax dream might as well be buried .	1.7875366902570589
why do i think we need the directive so much ?	1.0055082135593791
this makes the large number of amendments and far too long a wish list of possible tasks all the more astonishing .	1.0872295993448173
is one free when security is no longer assured ?	1.0872325181396232
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the motion for a resolution before us today is important because of its subject and the desire to protect the rule of law and press freedom . it is also very important because of the broad consensus which has finally been reached after some heated discussions behind the scenes .	1.8784886736631727
as mr sterckx said , we certainly need to do this vis -à- vis the united states which , after all , is close to us in terms of democratic values .	1.0872294120658064
this is why the national front voted against the report .	1.2594572934242019
nor have you integrated it into economic policy , competition or the internal market .	1.087232519784384
we meet our deadlines and afterwards we are told that we should hold on and that in order to be reasonable we must go along with the position of the others , because in the codecision procedure there is just not enough time .	1.0872325198317045
this objective was fully and formally expressed in the statement adopted by the general affairs council in luxembourg on 8 april .	1.0872325197839026
these violent scenes at el ejido are so similar to archive pictures of alabama in the 1950s , when the kkk terrified the black population , that it is hard to tell them apart . they also put us in mind of germany in the 1930s , when the nazis were persecuting the jews .	1.0872307033047048
and yet we still have these problems in wales and in scotland .	1.0095762487912476
this is the only way to go forward , because the real way to deliver social justice in europe - and after all that is what we are all here to do - is to deliver prosperity and opportunities and jobs .	1.4559156320127065
therefore , apart from the apology which mr schüssel has made , offering us all kinds of guarantees , as did chamberlain and daladier in 1938 in munich , i would like to know whether the ppe intends to implement measures in relation to the austrian people ' s party , if it goes ahead with this mad project .	1.1193719523878256
where would europe ' s tourism industry be without the richness of our culture ?	1.0871557782352224
secondly , let me say quite clearly and plainly that we want to open the way to and offer fyrom accession to the european union .	1.0973415138244378
the commission will also support the presidency ' s efforts to clarify the judicial framework and the framework for police and judicial administrative cooperation in the fight against money laundering , an eminently cross - pillar issue .	1.0106040582967357
the community initiative means community involvement .	1.0115012447936542
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , we have now come to the end of a long road .	1.8478983915125606
there seem to be intractable technical problems but we are definitely working on it .	1.0837564223747718
this strategy , which took shape in the stability pact adopted on 10 june 1999 in cologne , considers south - east europe as a whole , but simultaneously recognises the diversity and unequal development of the various countries that compose the region .	1.0507576235069827
on the basis of the experience gained over the past eight years , an attempt is being made to increase the effectiveness of action on behalf of the environment in the third development phase of that financial instrument .	1.4980568890485155
the company went under despite this .	1.0872324380380352
the rapporteur has made laudable efforts , which should not go unnoted and for which i would like to thank him .	1.0152197801020166
yet , all too often these political priorities are invisible in everyday policies .	1.1007665568002192
including jörg haider ' s party in a coalition government makes the presence of the extreme right an everyday fact of life in europe , and sets an extremely dangerous precedent which may generate a serious aftermath in other union member states or in candidate countries .	1.1890257385338967
i also appeal to the austrian president , that he might yet look into all the possibilities for forming a government made up of democratic forces .	1.0872533080676818
( parliament adopted the resolution )	2.0918275939659643
i feel that the french authorities - which have the honour of housing the european parliament in strasbourg - should be aware of their responsibility to ensure adequate connections with all the capitals of the union .	1.4381017759176786
as important is the fact that austria ' s forces of democracy should be given support , as none of us wishes to isolate the country .	1.4389446989131098
modernising social protection	1.0081370885891408
my last point concerns the future palestinian state .	1.1171568892524928
this led to strikes and smear campaigns by intransigent trade unions , whereupon the proposals were abandoned and replaced by a wishy - washy compromise .	1.002554251338839
however , these isolated elements which make sense and for which we voted , in no way remedy the eurofederalist philosophy which characterises the community initiatives , particularly interreg .	1.0153229397833297
the commission is the executive and parliament ought to have no desire whatsoever to take on this role , for the sake of its own independence ; but parliament is a supervisory body , and what better forum could there be in which to expound the reasoning behind one ' s decisions than a democratically - elected parliament , indeed an ongoing parliamentary discussion ?	1.1025321558056764
but i am a little sad that the european development fund has still not been incorporated in the community budget .	1.0580776347604437
in this economy , the connection between different policy areas is that much more marked .	1.0872462424185725
mr president , i need not repeat what the rapporteur said or the points mr coelho made . all that is indeed very true and correct .	1.4054633045564437
how can the commission ensure that this sort of development financed through the structural funds does not conflict with the nature conservation needs of the area ?	1.0092797423376967
in theory , we could have done so .	1.039431963991048
this own initiative must not be destroyed by european intervention .	1.0872296101105137
if competition policy is to be made subordinate to the aims of social and environmental policy , real efficiency and economic growth will remain just a dream .	1.0875264086630512
without national reconciliation , reconciliation with europe is not possible .	1.0872325197859711
but we need that reform process .	1.0304164560039204
in that regard allow me to say , since i come from a country through which the danube flows , that i am grateful that the commission , i . e . commissioner patten and also vice - president palacio , with whom i was recently in budapest , is considering opening the danube to shipping again . that would provide for a modicum of economic recovery in this region too , which , of course , would be of particular importance to romania .	1.0872443668062128
we have regularly put our criticisms to the cuban authorities , and this parliament has done the same .	1.0872325198317065
that would erode the independence of the scientific advice .	1.0872512431131076
the recent helsinki decision to grant turkey accession country status , even though it has made not the slightest concession over the issue of its occupation of cyprus , for example , by reducing its military presence there or giving back ammokhostos , is clearly encouraging turkey ' s intransigence .	1.087232451867762
consequently , the commission has refrained from presenting an amendment . instead , it has limited itself to focusing its opinions on institutional issues .	1.6618086156775638
in particular , we should be working towards establishing genuine freedom of movement and resolving the problems of demilitarising and disarming the island .	1.2924816825144156
without them we would not be able to function .	1.0871532096196281
if you decide to add this debate to the agenda , it will be introduced by speeches from mr seixas da costa , president - in - office of the council , and mr romano prodi , president of the commission .	1.0837899297601095
thank you very much , commissioner solbes mira .	1.962759956081103
the first supporter of this reform should be parliament itself , if it really wants to increase its role of interpreting the will of the europeans and acquire the centrality which is part of a genuinely democratic and firmly integrated union .	1.0872301112482388
it should go hand in hand with our postal services in rural areas .	1.172802189080184
it is not just the sort of policing that we identify with community policemen on the street corner .	1.310429939076559
the form the aid takes is important .	1.087232517803243
secondly , i understand the worry of industry regarding legal certainty .	1.0019842129147911
in a global village , major discrepancies in the world will not , in the longer term , be tolerated by the poorest section of the village .	1.0336173344441615
i very much admire him for keeping his spirits up at a time when he was inundated with so many amendments .	1.0031992168868509
it will become more difficult once we see the tse proposal , mr byrne .	1.0324875578930137
with a figure for trade in goods and services of frf 36 000 billion only being equal to the product of four days ' speculation , the financial bubble owes very little to the productive activity of individuals .	1.0872880904426956
in addition , i should like to make a number of comments :	1.4203708534823927
it aims to strengthen consumer protection and security .	1.0069039712983565
if we have not been able to reach agreement internally , i wonder whether we will then be able to convince the other trade partners .	1.0217741434042815
madam president , my group was one of those which wanted to have a document allowing an exchange of views on the commission ' s strategic objectives within the group before this debate , instead of being reduced to an on - the - spot reaction in plenary .	1.0863608208096993
we are increasingly concerned in this house about public opinion . the fear of public opinion is a rather paternalistic concept but our house is what it is and we must do what we can with it .	1.331471655487215
we have had the dioxin scare , bse and many other problems .	1.1070880819515005
mr poettering , it goes without saying that commissioner patten ' s participation in this debate is most opportune , and we have agreed that i will allow him to speak when he so wishes .	1.2004521172747928
it is important that we know who the actors are and what their credit rating is .	1.6937800918734087
question no 29 by ( h - 0786/99 ):	1.0873398210125467
of course , if consensus could be reached on this issue at the intergovernmental conference , there might eventually be progress .	1.0140383628636191
people have the gall to say they benefit from the lomé convention , but even looking at trading relations alone , the lomé convention has done nothing to protect those countries ; their already feeble share in trade with europe has been halved .	1.0872325198305801
i am very much afraid that some will prefer to receive no financing rather than reveal their poor management . this has already been seen in cases where the sending of this data was compulsory , as with the magps .	1.1992446375257373
and when that assessment is complete , we will be able to establish whether the resources at our disposal are commensurate with the tasks attributed to us .	1.0096890828534177
can i begin by stating for the record and for the enlightenment of mrs langenhagen that the decision for me not to address the full plenary tomorrow and therefore be available for formal responses on the report is not mine and not the commission ' s - it was the decision of this parliament !	1.0838356875210662
we in the commission are obliged to set a specific and clear example and all the commissioners are working together , as can be seen from the reform of the commission , to achieve 40% representation of women on all the committees of the european commission .	1.0617825610980243
nevertheless , despite these aspects , european citizens are disappointed and concerned : by unemployment which is not falling quickly enough ; by a europe trailing behind in technology , and seemingly falling even further behind , and in particular a scientific sector which is starting to lag a long way behind too ; by the european institutions which appear distant and do not seem to be in step with the times , starting with the commission itself .	1.0872325198317052
mr president , the launch of the euro could well be a heaven - sent opportunity for counterfeiters .	1.2934161668034414
however , because of the mixture of roles of both financial management and control , and audit under the present terms , it is very difficult to think of this as an uncompromised role , no matter how great the integrity of the person actually holding it .	1.9671978898378708
food security programmes in central asia began in 1996 , following two previous years when the european union provided food aid in kind .	1.087232519830601
mr president of the commission , allow me to close with these words : as the group of the european people ' s party and the european democrats , we have every interest in a strong commission .	1.9785727698681137
i do not know whether these proposals will meet with a favourable reception or not .	1.3738466773687166
that is easier said than done - we are still discussing some of the toughest issues .	1.087232519786063
another important aspect is the improvement of the eu ' s trade regime for all least - developed countries , 39 of which are actually in the acp group .	1.0504158856383135
the recent disaster on the danube serves as a reminder that our rivers are the lifelines of our planet and that pollution does not respect borders .	1.08712040497145
mr president , for those unfortunate investors even real euros are false money .	1.023451634834618
those having to deal with these risks should therefore meet stringent requirements .	1.1143206868080073
the debate is closed .	1.1675438313701068
one way to achieve this is to have total transparency as far as food labelling is concerned .	1.0854459167355985
finally , the socialist group agrees with activity - based budgeting and with responsibilisation and you will be judged , as mr prodi says , by your actions , not your words .	1.005759610753088
the importance to the economy of tourism and its growth potential is obviously one .	1.143334757970585
however , as mr marinho has pointed out , more is necessary , but that has to wait for the igc ,	1.1199931779629526
mr president , personally i voted in favour of this resolution , because the essential thing is that the european parliament should discuss the postal service and we should get away from the current ambiguous situation .	1.0002981066137324
there is one thing , however , that we cannot deny , and that is that mr kouchner ' s efforts to return kosovo ' s internal situation to normal have been extremely positive .	1.3900674450693515
i am optimistic and quite relaxed and confident about the vote ; we shall gain broad support for this opinion on equal .	1.3564093475506191
so , for example , the island of réunion is located on a trade axis between the countries of southern africa and those of south - east asia .	1.009444875674053
i say it again , the european union ' s cooperation and development policy is not coherent . and on behalf of the green group i call on parliament , the institutions and the commission to make a joint effort , at long last , to put some coherence into our policy .	1.0872299664545635
europe should regularise the situation of all its illegal immigrants and grant them right of asylum and the right to vote in all elections . only then can we talk in this house about an area of freedom and justice .	1.0872298974155539
for all these reasons i thought it essential to reply directly to mr van hecke ' s question on this issue .	1.885529378457866
mr president , the intergovernmental conference mandate needs to be widened .	1.293792416871766
people react by voting with their feet and go where they can earn a crust .	1.0872325198317052
the ppe - de group is requesting that this item be taken off the agenda .	1.5130631732862374
on the one hand we ask applicant countries to take on board the environmental acquis and yet , at the very same time , the eu member states are supporting and encouraging investment in those countries which is itself hugely environmentally damaging .	1.0923065014036983
some of the amendments in your report pose this question .	1.1374570528940477
we are told we should change the limit from 350 grammes to 150 grammes , or even 50 grammes .	1.0872325198320167
madam president , on a point of order .	1.210538129137532
even though , as the commission says , the texts of the treaties do not contain special provisions to regulate all the respective issues raised by technological development , it can nevertheless be said that within the legislative framework created , performing or interpreting artists enjoy broader protection than that accorded by the treaty of rome or even by the community directives .	1.3866029590714746
indeed you responded in kind , as i knew you would do .	1.0872324546001293
if we have been having a different debate here in this chamber today then that only goes to show how important this is .	1.0099560025082228
the second involves serious managerial shortcomings in the commission , in particular in relation to coordination across departments and management of external contracts .	1.0872325179464863
this war must be stopped .	1.08718519509716
nevertheless , i have to say that the same authorities have expressed their concern about the pressure they may come under to resolve the issues raised by partition , which will evidently imply some concessions .	1.476661834792038
that proposal will establish a duty to cooperate , and a duty on the part of the national authorities to notify europol of cases of counterfeiting and to present any confiscated counterfeit money to the european central bank for identification and classification , so that effective measures can then be taken .	1.0079507090791464
i think that you have aged , your face is quite lined .	1.0175164147187314
that is one of the issues that we address in the annex to the legislation , and the intention is to establish a positive list for feed material .	1.1587867691345755
what you have as a result are all these major trusts that cut jobs while their profits are high , and which often make staff redundant simply to make their share price rise on the stock market .	1.023330442606049
i know that this is an extremely delicate issue , but we should all be questioning the logic behind this resolution and its chances of being implemented .	1.6713149937129512
in that respect we must recognise this innovation , this step , even if , as mr schulz just pointed out , simply supplementing a rather old convention is not really a particularly bold step .	1.0248502463704956
the debate is suspended and will resume at 9 p . m .	1.0003927954326273
all the signs point towards a second round of attacks on yugoslavia and this is confirmed by the kla attacks on serbs in mitrovica , the attempt to annex three towns in southern serbia to kosovo , the promotion of the independence of kosovo , the fact that two thousand men have been channelled into kosovo via greece , despite the objections of the greek people and , at the same time , intense efforts by nato and the european union to overturn the legitimate government of yugoslavia .	1.0872325412451618
we want to see that follow - through to a much greater extent in future .	1.3384261885639608
our general policy however , is to recognise the inherent dignity and the unique contribution of indigenous people to the development and plurality of society , something we are looking at particularly keenly in the context of the northern dimension which we are trying to develop and which we are discussing with north america .	1.0872339628476826
i will take another look at the issue , although i should point out that having two phare programmes up and running risks real confusion .	1.0061780096041346
it is perfectly correct that we need to apply this in certain cases .	1.0314199009184684
furthermore , if the courts cannot deal appropriately and expeditiously with the legal workload placed on them , what happens , as madame palacio vallelersundi has already pointed out , is that justice delayed becomes , as we know , justice denied .	1.1319815075433075
this house is very good at producing resolutions and legislation and we sometimes , in this institution , forget that europe cannot survive alone .	1.0196089952156355
that goes far beyond your new economic and social agenda or a new , better quality of life .	1.0839390121160848
what i can say is that i hope that this building will now be occupied as soon as possible .	1.008961127386483
last november , the commission tabled a proposal for an anti - racism directive .	1.4377474464867648
local politicians cannot do that , once legislation has been passed in brussels .	1.0872294668906677
then , last november , before the ceasefire was over , the spanish government spokesman , mr piqué, declared that his government had done and would in the future do everything possible to hinder present moves towards a political solution in the basque country .	1.0871315607359338
in this way , europe would truly belong to the citizens and the union would acquire an entirely new quality of democratic legitimacy .	1.428335909985235
but i do not think he answered my question with regard specifically to tackling homelessness and housing and whether the portuguese presidency would be willing to meet the non - governmental organisations actively involved in this field .	1.7576115667055492
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )	2.122894691293275
finally , on large - scale energy transmission networks , the guidelines also provide for financial participation from the funds to develop these networks where this helps to reduce dependency on an external supplier or to combat the effects of isolation .	1.0019037321136257
in short , we must not allow real capital and speculative capital to become so remote from each other , because otherwise we shall be steering towards situations which we experienced on this continent time and again during the last century and which had catastrophic results .	1.306573155384969
some may think that the budgetary point should be looked at in due course .	1.0871207273217303
mrs roth - behrendt , we already have a tüv ( organisation for safety testing ) for ships in the form of the classification companies .	1.283519091003177
i would therefore ask members to examine my amendment carefully , and i hope that tomorrow we will achieve a result .	1.4265893549005586
i am delighted to welcome a delegation of the hong kong legislative council to parliament .	1.5338956275108182
we need to be able to go back with a proper answer .	1.3537572724648255
i want to make it quite clear that in this specific case i personally consider the commission ' s proposal to be wrong and feel that it remains to be seen as to whether we are truly justified in using the term " modernisation " to describe the content of articles 81 and 82 of the white paper , or whether in this case it would be more appropriate to use the expression " retrograde step " .	1.1516470039811808
without wishing to lump everything together hysterically , because each period is different , we have failed to learn the lessons of history .	1.0076506508363199
thus , mr president , i ask my fellow members to approve this report and i ask the commission , as other speakers have done , to take good note of the conclusions of their sixth periodic report when they address the programming for the period 2000 - 2006 .	1.1585382486495492
now , following the amsterdam treaty , the rights of information and control granted to the european parliament in the past need to be enshrined anew in an interinstitutional agreement .	1.083775629090625
i also look forward to the white paper which will be available in february .	1.0134707258990165
allow me to say just one word . i agree that the working group should have met earlier but at least , once it did , important decisions were taken straight away .	1.272772696134708
if we are to be able to motivate everybody , i believe it is extremely important for this message to be sent all the way from the top down or , if you prefer , from the bottom up .	1.4378914396051674
the high level of protection aimed at by the common position would be very much undermined if the recycling objective for the year 2006 were removed .	1.048578096000555
but i have come to the conclusion that it was in fact quite clever timing .	1.006998946740898
this initiative should give the countryside new impetus to develop and test new and original ideas , ideas which it is then intended should at a later stage be incorporated in the general programmes as models .	1.0137675946085924
mr tajani will accept that it is a little difficult to understand the relationship between his intervention and the points of order , but i understand his political meaning .	1.087264183321771
concerning article 366a , i can say that , during the negotiations for a new partnership agreement , a new procedure was established for dealing with instances where human rights and the principles of democracy and the rule of law are infringed .	1.0872441247351707
at the end of the day , i honestly do not believe that this fear is justified .	2.0687564369557814
this is because the 15% increase is nominal and not real , granted that average yearly inflation in the community during those years was approximately 2%.	1.1604437177252647
finally , if you consider the overall amount , which is on the small side , - eur 2 . 8 billion for 15 member states - and how ambitious the objectives are , i am afraid that all we shall succeed in doing is to prove that unemployment is a bad thing .	1.198209718645202
on the basis of these views , we wish to express our categorical opposition to the ' modernisation ' of the social protection system that the commission statement is promoting , and to make it clear that we cannot vote in favour of the report by the committee on employment and social affairs which is under discussion .	1.1936644465769677
thank you very much .	1.0247193793965739
therefore , our task is to make the requirements in the directive tighter and more concrete .	1.0882981605262338
at or around the time of president clinton ' s visit to china , the president of the people ' s republic of china gave the impression that dialogue was on the agenda .	1.0872295236708633
a country which acted in that way would bring a lot of ill will upon itself .	1.0043774964705132
if that does not meet with a positive response , the difficult issue of which of our lower - priority activities should be discontinued will then have to be addressed , not just by the commission , but by this parliament and by the council too .	1.086409910908494
we will use all the means available to permanently strengthen the community of values which we have been building together since the founding of the union in 1957 , and even before that , on the rubble of the second world war .	1.7229900491047139
the council statement on the position of the european union on developments concerning cyprus ;	1.4989658706012752
mr marset campos , regardless of how we may see things with hindsight - and it is easy to see things with the benefit of hindsight , if you take no action yourself - i believe that , if we look at what happened in bosnia and herzegovina , and at the impunity that the situation in bosnia and herzegovina led to , and the continuation of that impunity , then we might perhaps see the nato military action in kosovo in a somewhat less catastrophic light .	1.3317387422517217
can commissioner patten update us on the international coordination so far ?	1.0872324422753288
that is why i should like to support the social democrats ' request to hold the vote on friday .	1.4700538792340747
when we hold intergovernmental conferences and consider changes to the treaty , we must take into account the fact that the eu is developing all the time , sometimes in contravention of the treaty , as we have just seen .	1.0313405825382007
in terms of the igc issue , i have a specific question for you . i believe that the court of justice in luxembourg is currently looking very closely at the important issue of the fight against fraud and olaf .	1.3752971072182483
one of the precepts of democracy is that we should not disapprove of electoral outcomes but respect them , and that is why we must respect the fact that the austrians , by virtue of their political culture , voted as they did .	1.0011432182234627
the next item is the report ( a5 - 0001/2000 ) by mr van hulten , on behalf of the committee on budgetary control , on action to be taken on the second report of the committee of independent experts on reform of the commission .	4.54783493279473
it does , however , support my view that i am not , apparently , the only one who cannot agree with the majority opinion .	1.4631978152471619
if national governments had in their hearts - as the european union has in its heart with this directive - the proliferation of money earned during the course of a working life , the pensions time bomb would already have been defused .	1.0202141991461797
even within the eu citizens still suffer human rights violations and a breach of our conventions .	1.0066009218778524
at the commission ' s suggestion , the mudflats at stegrennan were formally included in the boyne estuary special protection area , from which they had previously been excluded .	1.9482227143959494
our proposals are particularly concerned with the age of oil tankers .	1.0872324410075107
i would ask you to bring this specific case , which has to do with the ventilators on a particular floor , to the attention of the quaestors , who are , in fact , responsible for the matter .	2.0644384338651647
as soon as the opinion is adopted here in parliament , the guidelines for leader+ will again be presented to the star committee so that the member states can confirm the provisional agreement which they gave on 14 november .	1.2625957883694954
we cannot have a decisive and fair europe unless it is also open and democratic .	1.426102706484145
the internal market is the basis for our work .	1.1034589101072334
without wishing to ignore the progress which has been made , we , the european parliament , would like to draw your attention to the unwillingness on the part of the council to implement these decisions in many areas , as well as its lack of common vision and , in particular , the lack of transparency and cooperation with the european parliament .	1.007986204011179
the commission ' s declared intention to regulate the conditions of competition on the european market is ridiculous , for the only law which competition respects is the law of the jungle where the most powerful squash or devour the weakest elements .	1.0135209000367147
i will tell you a few things we should do .	1.4429297811043513
this would in fact demand a change to the recently adopted amsterdam treaty .	1.083662467854338
my colleague poul nielson is literally on his way to mozambique this afternoon and evening together with the portuguese secretary of state to assess the situation on the ground .	1.0872325198317052
we do believe that it is extremely important to give financial support to conventional fishing and craft trades and to boost the income of fishermen during periods when moratoria on fishing are in force : in short , we must make it possible to carry on a major , responsible economic activity while still ensuring proper respect for the environment .	1.0855833991815422
you have to admit : this is a joke .	1.0919765336894145
in particular , as agreed at the human rights council group on 9 february 2000 , the european union intends to table draft resolutions on the israeli settlements , iran , iraq , sudan , the democratic republic of the congo , burma/myanmar , a draft chairman ' s statement on colombia , and , possibly , on east timor , together with a draft statement on the situation in various countries .	1.0332540565838413
why has the commission not informed us of this formal request from macedonia ?	1.010400819235045
the thought of an incident of this kind occurring in the near future should concentrate her mind and the minds of her officials wonderfully .	1.0872709886433713
if it were , turkey would have a sort of right of veto over the accession of cyprus to the european union , which is , of course , unacceptable .	1.1487791626898878
this proposal is still being discussed by the council and parliament on the basis of the codecision procedure .	1.009767910644563
the income and employment generated by tourism help enormously in reducing imbalances and encouraging their economies to converge with the average rate of growth in the community .	1.0872325198317052
because anyone who develops a project and has it ready will also want to start implementing it as soon as possible .	1.0872325198317052
for safety ' s sake , i should like to have confirmation that it really is the case that , where the commission and good administration are concerned , there is no part of jacob söderman ' s proposal which the commission thinks is unacceptable .	1.0883836304389962
following nassau , a delegation from parliament led by mr corrie and the chairman of the committee on development and cooperation , joaquín miranda , visited havana and a series of very illuminating exchanges of opinion took place .	1.0871558570581275
therefore , will the commission state when they intend to propose under article 7 . 1 that there is ' the existence of a serious and persistent breach by a member state of the principles mentioned in article 6 . 1 .' , and urge the council acting by qualified majority to suspend certain rights deriving from the application of this treaty to austria including the voting rights of the representative of austria in the council ?	1.1206604795445065
this will not help us to reform the european institutions whilst fully respecting democratic institutions .	1.0038610160678667
i should , however , like to add that no new scientific knowledge was needed which proved that the experimental infection of sheep by feeding them bse - infected feed produced a clinical expression of the disease which is indistinguishable from the symptoms of scrapie .	1.6665005150384804
as to the proposal to establish a maximum custodial sentence of not less than eight years , i do not think that this will raise any problems as far as my country is concerned , even though the maximum sentence for counterfeiting under its criminal code is currently five years in prison , as it has already expressed willingness to make this amendment .	1.00656260122014
here too we should continue along the path we have chosen , strengthening and intensifying it .	1.0232978902400196
but can you also provide confirmation concerning the matter i raise in my question , namely that the programme will be designed in such a way that we shall obtain a concrete timetable for the various types of legislation in the social sphere which the commission is planning , as well as for those initiatives which the commission is planning with regard to dialogue between the two sides of industry ?	1.0872325198317052
let me finish by addressing some of the other concerns expressed in the draft resolution submitted to this house .	1.0872325202798554
i would like to appeal to those ministers not to cast doubt upon that agreement which was really very difficult to reach .	1.0565741811149016
this is a distant goal , but is one that can be attained in stages .	1.0046943879660444
it becomes scarcer when it is mismanaged and when the geographical and climatic conditions are unfavourable .	1.08722939229116
we are concerned here with the harmonisation of examination requirements but also , in fact , with minimum requirements .	1.6233485456740342
in this respect , it must be stressed that it is the expenditure financed by the structural funds which must be additional .	1.4326781461266533
we should therefore do what is necessary to update the areas in which we can intervene , with renewed strength , to safeguard human rights .	1.0178813111104956
the second recommendation relates to criminal proceedings .	1.0254278064568818
i also want to add that , when it comes to groundwater and to water which has been heavily modified by human activities , i support a tighter timetable and a clarification of goals and of criteria for allowing exceptions to the rules . i also support expressly mentioning radioactive substances .	1.0700706060912597
there can also be no doubt that bluefin tuna is of enormous environmental and financial significance .	1.0841904418010386
the council and parliament must work together to provide the resources that the commission needs .	1.2995190451975869
there is no question of it allowing xenophobic , racist and anti - semitic ministers to be tolerated at within it .	1.3581439869556169
the working document prepared by the court itself contains alarming information .	1.0872294541618146
we nonetheless foresee two problems for which solutions will need to be found .	1.0872325198321657
koch report ( a5 - 0104/1999 )	2.0747145731944836
the commission already has a list of 32 priority substances , many of which have a hormone - deregulating effect .	1.0465405396046337
today , europe is facing a similar challenge , and we know that , just as history has been unforgiving in the past , it will not be forgiving in the present .	1.0837537241345283
it is easy to see that the car industry in certain countries , for example in germany , went in for some pretty tough lobbying before the present directive was adopted .	1.1886321279758858
if people are to be free to provide services across borders it is only fair and reasonable that we should have european regulations to govern it .	1.1141069527114968
if the commission implements the white paper objectives , it seems to me that discrimination within the internal market and between external and internal legal advisers will become more pronounced and hence even less acceptable .	1.0014435505806263
they are no substitute for rigorous regular inspection .	1.0131844768716847
the vast majority of them are not members of any party .	1.3266243608709736
we have condemned basque and irish terrorism .	1.087232517803243
a very important proposal indeed .	1.0106596792300964
as i have said , my colleague , commissioner wallström , is on the spot today .	1.9918169355042084
competition yes , restrictions in state aid where necessary and where possible .	1.0872325198317052
and , for want of appropriations , we lose this legitimacy and allow the idea that these european directives of ours are not reasonable and are not applicable to develop .	1.0041682219549517
we must be prepared to act swiftly to support the consolidation of peace in the region .	1.0091280932501494
why should it be impracticable to set this tax at a rate which does not jeopardise the long - term investments needed by the economy but which finally makes short - term and speculative investments unattractive .	1.3604014264717654
so the " grappa war " is over .	1.0872325197827875
consequently , amendment no 107 , on the same question , has been tabled by one section of our group only .	1.0838835802582703
it also reminds us of the need for a new growth model , one that is firmly rooted in the culture of the catholics who are involved in social problems , who see , in the civil community and the social interaction that that must be encouraged and facilitated among the public , the most natural instruments for building solidarity .	1.0884940423746197
what is necessary is to throw some sand into the wheels of the currency speculators , stockbrokers and option traders .	1.0871207950984199
nobody doubts that water is a resource of interest to all of us .	1.0880657988225813
there is one thing i would like to make quite clear though . parliament is a legislative body , but the fact that we have no more than the right of consultation in matters of competition law , of all things , is truly scandalous .	1.5630552829801554
but , going beyond this petty political operation , what the majority in the european parliament is afraid of most of all is that the threat to the left - right cohabitation in austria , which caused political life to stagnate and rot , may soon spread to the european system of co - management which is producing equally appalling results .	1.08583320909658
lastly then , europol , which started its work in 1999 . the council approved a set of instruments , with which parliament is familiar , to make europol ' s operations viable but , of course , the fundamental issues of democratic control and judicial control of europol still remain , and these are issues which have naturally taken on a new dimension in view of the political decision taken in tampere to reinforce europol ' s powers and , above all , to give it an operational dimension .	1.0871838573468724
to summarise , the commission is able to approve 72 amendments , either in their entirety , partially or in principle .	1.156568595158445
however , the measures that may subsequently be taken must obviously comply with the general principles applicable to risk management and the guidelines for applying the precautionary principle are therefore the key element of the paper .	1.03199832352749
in relation to mrs lynne ' s question on interim payments : that is a matter that might very well be addressed by parliament as it relates to budget issues .	1.0043106763795513
i should also draw your attention to the significance of the barcelona process which should have a beneficial impact on regional cooperation .	1.0017565031634872
from all accounts , this would only serve to strengthen haider .	1.0872297046844062
it was intended that the study should indicate monthly closures to purse seine , in order that the closures would be effective for the conservation of bluefin stock .	1.501101610516877
that is important and something that can be developed through the lisbon summit .	1.0406929310181539
if the lamented lack of coherence should happen to have something to do with this point , then i am bound to say that this regulation is a legal framework and nothing more than that .	1.0872298722981815
it is probable , therefore , that there is a lot of life out there , and much of it much more advanced than we are .	1.0872411668985913
it does deal with the substance of the problem some of you have raised .	1.0872038787213478
this particular communication from the commission forms part of the commission ' s overall strategy of improving the integration of environmental considerations into other community policies .	1.0905620053905876
the erika disaster must be the last in the series .	1.0099610008541045
when will those responsible at last understand that sparing resources is not something we do for fun ; nor is it just a question of creating a system for its own sake or a new study group , rather it is a joint european challenge .	1.087130046270844
for its part , the european union , with its hypocritical professions of interest in freedom and human rights , has never been moved by the drama of the cypriot people , by the problem of greek and turkish cypriot refugees , by the enforced change of the population composition in the north of cyprus , or by the wholesale settlement of colonists by turkey in the occupied areas .	2.1931448413778822
as far as this is concerned , the report , albeit a component , may well be the key component of lisbon , because it is really innovative , while many other things are merely a rumination of what has been said before .	1.1131645128916643
madam president , mr prodi , europe needs a strong commission .	1.4505115461950167
i am disappointed in the epp .	1.1248254732213563
the draft that the council has elaborated contains provisions on a variety of matters that have been discussed by several members of parliament .	1.08727947706991
i too should like to ask the european union to put its own house in order here , i . e . to call on member states which still have gold mines to commission expert reports , so that we know just what the situation is .	2.343632933243548
i would like to answer these two questions as follows .	1.060920449459812
the environment must be a priority area within the reunification of the european continent .	1.3210883012466694
today we must give the green light to this conference , and , for its part , the group of the european people ' s party , mr president , is ready to give that green light .	1.10008208642895
mr president , ever since i was elected to this parliament in 1994 i have never witnessed a report which had such anti - irish sentiments and overtones as the jonckheer report which we are debating today .	1.003628299554183
i say this because the failure of a bank is a problem for which any government can find a solution .	1.448823439740663
social exclusion , the programme for women , the efforts we are making in the social protection area , everything needs to be looked at now in the light of the new reality of the information society .	1.1059202125194132
since the time allotted to questions to the council has elapsed , questions nos 11 to 35 will be replied to in writing .	1.498083891033858
what was mentioned concerning sugar in the caribbean is more complicated .	1.0153277919456536
that is something we must guard against .	1.3921562989870382
we consider it to be indispensable and urgently needed and hope that it actually comes up with the goods that will enable us to carry out enlargement of the european union in the not too distant future .	1.7264718985483878
president .	1.0267350551323842
" he knew what those jubilant crowds did not know but could have learned from books : that the plague bacillus never dies or disappears for good ; that it can lie dormant for years and years in furniture and linen - chests ; that it bides its time in bedrooms , cellars , trunks , and bookshelves ; and that perhaps the day would come when , for the bane and the enlightening of men , it would rouse up its rats again and send them forth to die in a happy city . "	1.084183956264451
add to this the fact that he had to do this from his green approach and , against that background , find a compromise . that was not easy .	1.690969918036134
naturally any dialogue as complex as the one on human rights is going to be a long - term process , but i wish i could point to more real gains .	1.0872325187340797
this is important in the interests of transparency and the overall effectiveness of networks .	1.1823398632214441
finally , this directive should enter into force at the earliest opportunity .	1.0083622795266989
this is what we need to do for the balkans .	1.6192524793145182
now , as he said , in excess of 85 000 tons of salmon is now produced in scottish fish farms in an industry which generates more than eur 800 million annually .	1.0060806503688218
these very innovative approaches provide a good opportunity to improve governance .	1.0872325792020063
journalists , on the other hand , who are simply going about their work in russia , i . e . endeavouring to produce reports which are as objective as possible , are being treated like criminals .	1.1384071644670841
on the other hand , it does not accept amendment no 4 .	1.7886895757648842
regarding the fight against organised crime , 1999 marked the implementation of several important actions stemming from the vienna action plan , which resulted in the signing of the charter of european professional associations , in developments in cooperation and in establishing points of contact between the member states for receiving information relevant to the fight against money laundering . and i must not forget the finnish presidency ' s proposal for a council decision which is being considered in the multi - disciplinary group .	1.1420972996245717
at the same time , it is important to appreciate the economic importance of financial business dealings , particularly those we are concerned with today .	1.7514088925797722
in my opinion , this is the only way if we want to gain the approval of the people with regard to europe and their interest in europe too .	1.4571180806648403
the truth is the greatest problem is a political one : they do not want to tax capital , but raise personal taxation instead .	1.100955383089355
it is also necessary to exercise authority as closely as possible to the citizens , where it can be exercised with due transparency and can be monitored by the citizens themselves .	1.03215565272431
the inconsistency is astonishing .	1.087117460207572
parliament must have more involvement and i also believe that if we were to introduce a register in which we could ascertain what state aid is being granted , then this would encourage the member states to be more disciplined .	1.019752426822678
our absolute objective must be to create the prior conditions for all countries in south - east europe to be integrated with other countries in the eu - economically , politically and in terms of trade .	1.0883620620371297
it is particularly important to address those serious issues concerning urban areas , employment in rural areas , aid to agricultural regions and equal development opportunities for the islands of the european union and for the greek islands which , of course , comprise half of the islands of the union , as stipulated in article 158 of the treaty .	1.4782214597183985
firstly , i would like to see a joint parliamentary assembly of elected members from acp countries and not ambassadors or government ministers sitting there as delegates .	2.6998324323307417
i thank the president - in - office for his reply .	2.394101602209763
but , at the same time , the single currency and the absence of labour mobility , as well as of a redistributive fiscal policy , force us into a situation of non - convergence in terms of salaries and welfare , in order to compensate for the differences in marginal productivity at national and regional levels .	3.7273210643348786
we therefore all agree on the established facts , and the draft regulation and the report are going in the right direction .	1.0876854207163529
high unemployment in the european union concerns all of us , especially now that the downward trend does not seem to be persisting .	1.084345085563617
in addition , measures must be taken to combat differences on the grounds of gender .	1.0070468287662884
we want to achieve a completely flexible solution .	1.0276395125981046
that is why we need transparency .	1.5462531190415456
i am not one of the people who agrees that there is a vast lack of trust .	1.04832062032766
we have listened to the commission ' s explanations about the long internal process involved in transposing legislation . this has simply left us with an image of an exasperating bureaucracy .	1.739606851606854
in a sense this is where its work begins .	1.0243180023963543
i can go into that in detail if the honourable member would like but there is no doubt that we are on all fours with the ombudsman on this important issue .	1.0259038922055996
lastly , i would like to state once again that the commission intends to be in the pole position in presenting proposals for implementing the treaty of amsterdam .	2.877505439189656
i would like to point out that , within this broad consensus , there were some groups which said that the majority of parliament should form an opposition to the majority of the council .	1.2945814102037394
even today , surely it is high time for the party of european socialists to break their fraternal links with china ' s communist party .	1.0032492247153166
several people have lost their lives , many have disappeared , many have been injured .	1.087150013135856
i see the commissioner smiling but i speak with the authority of all the political parties in northern ireland , a diverse crowd but all agreed on this one issue .	1.0116880521370928
these authorities must also help to achieve difficult agreements between the parties involved and must not hinder these , as has happened with the mayor in question .	1.0872608755015893
but access to national responsibilities often depends upon the introduction to politics provided by such local mandates .	1.0872325198316801
does the council intend to raise the question of the definitive status of kosovo ?	1.8155692551886267
this house will today approve a very important and appropriate joint motion for a resolution tabled by several groups .	1.0133620974076305
i think your intervention may clarify various points that were raised .	1.0872325198316897
our second criticism is that the system was very restrictive of the commission .	1.087313444437058
if it should become apparent that one or more classification companies have provided reports by way of favours then they should be struck off the list of authorised classification companies .	1.084409373547439
i really do wonder whether this is an approach of which the green environment ministers in my country are aware .	1.0872324499839963
the truth is that the european parliament is still failing to gain the confidence and interest of national public opinion which is determined not to think about europe , as demonstrated by the low turnout in the recent elections .	2.108721022904543
today , following the 1997 compromise , member states can give public monopolies responsibility for the postal service involving mail and parcels whose distribution cost is less than five times the basic tariff , with a weight of less than 350 grammes .	1.0837864823655161
incidentally , it is ironic that the problem is much less serious for the feedingstuffs of our dogs , cats and other domestic animals .	1.083547837156694
